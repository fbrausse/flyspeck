The series of papers in this volume gives a proof of the Kepler
conjecture, which asserts that the density of a packing of congruent
spheres in three dimensions is never greater than
$\pi/\sqrt{18}\approx 0.74048\ldots$. This is the oldest problem in
discrete geometry and is an important part of Hilbert's 18th
problem. An example of a packing achieving this density is the
face-centered cubic packing.
