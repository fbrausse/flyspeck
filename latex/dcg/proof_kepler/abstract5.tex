This paper is the fifth in a series of papers devoted to the proof
of the Kepler conjecture, which asserts that no packing of congruent
balls in three dimensions has density greater than the face-centered
cubic packing.

In this paper, we prove that decomposition stars associated with the
plane graph of arrangements we term pentahedral prisms do not
contravene.  Recall that a contravening decomposition star is a
potential counterexample to the Kepler conjecture. We use interval
arithmetic methods to prove particular linear relations on
components of any such contravening decomposition star.  These
relations are then combined to prove that no such contravening stars
exist.
