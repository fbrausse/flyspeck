\section{Introduction}
% 7 pages.


I am here today to describe some identities of integrals that have
been established by NBC.  In mathematics, we have an endless supply of
integrals and of identities of integrals.  My task today will be to
describe why these identities took nearly 30 years to prove and why
they have particular importance for investigations in the theory of
automorphic representations.






\subsection{Origins of the fundamental lemma}


To orient ourselves to the fundamental lemma, we give two examples of
behavior that endoscopy is designed to explain.


\begin{example}  For each $n\ge 2$, consider the vector space $V^+_n$
of all holomorphic functions on the upper half plane ${\frak h}$ that
are square integrable:
\[
\int_{\frak h} |f|^2 y^{n-2} dx\, dy < \infty.
\]
$SL_2(\ring{R})$ acts on $V^+_n$:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \cdot f(z) = 
(-b z + d ) ^{-n} f (\frac{\phantom{-}a z - c}{-b z + d}).
\]
For each $n\ge 2$, $SL_2$ also acts on the vector space $V^-_n$ of complex
conjugates of functions in $V^+_n$.
The characters of these infinite dimensional representations are represented by integrable functions
$\chi_{n,\pm}$.  In fact, $\chi_{n,+}(g)=\chi_{n,-}(g)$ except when $g$ is conjugate to a rotation
\[
t = \begin{pmatrix} \phantom{-}\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta\end{pmatrix}.
\] 
When $g$ is conjugate to $t$, a remarkable character identity holds:
\[
\chi_{n,-}(t) - \chi_{n,+}(t) = 
\frac{e^{i n \theta} + e^{- i n \theta}}{e^{i\theta}-e^{-i\theta}}.
\]
It is striking that numerator of the difference of two characters of
infinite dimension representations collapses to the character of a two
dimensional representation $t\mapsto t^n$ of the group $H$ of
rotations.  Shelstad gives general characters identities of this
sort~\cite{Sh}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
We find another early glimpse of the nascent theory in an exchange between Langlands and Singer.  Singer
expressed interest to Langlands in a particular alternating sum of
dimensions of spaces of cusp forms of $G=SL_2$ over a totally real
extension $F$ of $\ring{Q}$.  In 1974, Langlands replied to Singer in
a letter describing then unpublished joint work with
Labesse~\cite{Singer},~\cite{LL}.  The letter gives a formula for
this alternating sum, with terms indexed by the groups $H$ of norm 1
elements of quadratic extensions of $F$.  
\end{example}
%Letter to Singer 1974.

Langlands holds that  methods should be developed that are adequate for the
theory of automorphic representations in its full natural generality.
In ``full natural generality'' means going from $SL_2$ (or even
$\ring{G}_m$) to all reductive groups, from one local field to all
local fields, from local fields to global fields and back again, from
the geometric side of the trace formula to the spectral side and back
again.  Moreover,  interconnections between different reductive
groups and Galois groups should be included, as predicted by his
general principle of functoriality.

Thus, from these early calculations of Labesse and Langlands, the
general idea developed that one should account for alternating sums
that appear in the harmonic analysis on a reductive group $G$ in terms
of the harmonic analysis on groups $H$ of smaller dimension. 
The fundamental lemma is a concrete expression of this idea. 



\subsection{Endoscopic Groups}

The
smaller groups $H$ are called endoscopic groups.
Hints about how to define $H$ come from various sources.
\begin{itemize}
\item It should be constructed from $G,T,\kappa$.
\item Its roots are a subset of the roots of $G$ (although $H$ neededn't
be a subgroup of $G$).
\item Over $\ring{R}$, the presence or absence of a purely imaginary
root in $H$ is determined by whether the normalized $\kappa$-orbital
integral jumps across the hyperplane $\alpha=0$.
\item $H$ should have a Cartan subgroup $T_H\subset H$ isomorphic to
$T_G\subset G$, compatible with Weyl group actions $W_H\subset W_G$.
\item Over a nonarchimedean local field, there should be a Satake
homomorphism $f \mapsto \phi^*_Hf$, sending the spherical Hecke algebra
of $G$ to the spherical Hecke algebra of $H$.
\item It should generalize the example of Labesse and Langlands.
\end{itemize}

There are indications that the groups $H$ should be defined through  
the Langlands dual ${}^LG$ of $G$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Langlands's principle of functoriality asserts that the representation
theory of groups should be related when their dual groups are related.  The examples above are relations in representation theory.
\item The Satake transform identifies the spherical Hecke algebra with a ring of regular functions on a dual object.
\item The Tate-Nakayama isomorphism identifies $H^1(Gal,T)$
with a dual object.
\end{itemize}

The groups $H$ are defined as follows.  Let $s\in \hat T$ map
to the element representing $\kappa$ under the Tate-Nakayama isomorphism.
The connected component of the centralizer of $s$ is the dual $\bar H$
of a quasi-split reductive group.  The choice of
quasi-split inner form is determined by the requirement of a naturally
defined isomorphism $T_H\to T_G$ over $F$.

For example, if $G=SL_2$, the dual is $\hat G = PSL_2$.  The
If $T$ is split, $H^1(T)=1$, and the connected centralizer of $s$ in $\hat G$ is 

\subsection{The Kostant section}

The characteristic polynomial

The Kostant section appears throughout the proof as a way to pick
out a natural base point.  For example, the transfer factors $\Delta$
are normalized by setting $\Delta$ to be real and positive on the
Kostant section.  The fibers of the Hitchin fibration are nonempty
because of a base point given by the Kostant section.

\subsection{Real groups}

Let us return to the theme of accounting for alternating sums that
appear in the harmonic analysis on a reductive group $G$ in terms of
the harmonic analysis on groups $H$ of smaller groups, by looking at
the behavior of the orbital integrals of a reductive group $G$ defined
over $\ring{R}$.  Let $T$ be a Cartan subgroup of $G$.  A {\it purely
  imaginary root $\alpha$ of $T$} is one for which the Lie algebra of $T$
acts on the root space $\alpha$ by purely imaginary scalars.
Fix an imaginary root $\alpha$ and
consider the an alternating sum of orbital integrals of the form
\[
\sum_\gamma (\pm) (1-\alpha(\gamma^{-1})) \Phi(\gamma,f)
\]
where $f$ is Schartz function on $G(\ring{R})$, the sum runs over a
set of representatives of conjugacy class in $G(\ring{R})$ that become
conjugate in $G(\ring{C})$.  The summands are naturally parametrized
by a subset of a finite abelian $2$-group $A$, and we determine signs
by a choice of character $\kappa:A\to \{ \pm1 \}$.  The integral
depends smoothly on $\gamma$ when $\gamma$ is regular semisimple.
However, as $\gamma$ moves across the wall of $T$ determined by the
root $\alpha$, the integral can make a discontinuous jump or can extend
smoothly across the wall, depending on the particular choice of signs
$\kappa$.  

\begin{definition}
(Rough definition)
An endoscopic group $H$ associated with character $\kappa$ is a group
with the properties
\begin{itemize}
\item $H$ has a Cartan subgroup $T_H$ isomorphic to $T$.
\item The roots of $H$ are in natural bijection with a subset of the roots of $G$.
\item For each imaginary root $\alpha$ of $T$ in $G$, the root
lies in the root system of $H$ exactly when the orbital integral (*)
for a generic Schwartz function has a discontinuous jump across 
the wall of $T$ determined by $\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\section{Appendix: Reductions and Supplementary Results (3) pages}



This appendix describes some theorems related to the fundamental lemma.

Twisted Fundamental Lemma, Lie algebra, Weighted Fundamental Lemma, Reduction to Units, Smooth transfer, descent, transfer to char 0.

\subsection{Descent of identities of orbital integrals to the Lie algebra.}

A lemma of Harish-Chandra's asserts the transfer of an orbital
integral on $G$ near a singular semisimple element $z\gamma_0$, with
$z$ central, to an orbital integral on $C_G(\gamma_0)$, the
centralizer of $\gamma_0$.  This is called the descent of orbital
integrals.  Langlands and Shelstad made long calculations in
Galois cohomology to prove that the transfer factors are compatible
with Harish-Chandra's descent of orbital integrals.  The purpose of
their calculations was to make it possible to prove results about
orbital integrals by induction on the dimension of the group, and
thereby reduce smooth transfer and the fundamental lemma to identities
in a neighborhood of $\gamma_0=1$ contained in the image of the
exponential map.  Because of descent, identities can be proved in the
Lie algebra rather than in the group.


The original fundamental lemma has been supplemented by a twisted
fundamental lemma, conjectured by Kottwitz and Shelstad, where the
data is twisted by a nontrivial outer automorphism $\theta$ of the
group $G$.  In the untwisted case, the centralizer of an element fails
to give a group of smaller dimension precisely when the element is
central.  By contrast, a twisted centralizer (with respect to a
nontrivial outer automorphism) always has dimension less than $G$.  As
a consequence, descent always {\it untwists} the twisted fundamental
lemma into identities of ordinary orbital integrals.  If the
(standard) fundamental lemma is then applied, each $\kappa$-orbital
integral can be replaced with a stable orbital integral.  After
descent and stabilization, the twisted FL of Kottwitz and Shelstad
takes the form of identities of stable orbital integrals on the Lie
algebra (from which the automorphism and the character $\kappa$ have
entirely vanished).  The corresponding long calculations in Galois
cohomology that establish descent properties of the transfer factors
for the twisted fundamental lemma have been carried out by
Waldspurger.  NBC proves the general twisted fundamental lemma in
its untwisted stable form on the Lie algebra.


\subsection{The Hecke algebra}

The fundamental lemma is a statement about the transfer of all
functions in the spherical Hecke algebra.  A global argument based on
the trace formula shows that the fundamental lemma holds for the full
Hecke algebra for an arbitrary nonarchimedean local field of
characteristic zero, provided it holds for the unit element of the
Hecke algebra for local fields of sufficiently large residual
characteristic.  The idea of the proof is to choose suitable global
functions for which the comparison of stable trace formulas yields an
obstruction to the fundamental lemma.  This obstruction takes the form
of a linear map $L:{\mathcal H}\to V$ on the local spherical Hecke
algebra ${\mathcal H}$ of the endoscopic group into a finite
dimensional complex vector space $V$.  By purely local arguments, it
can be shown that no nonzero linear map $L$ exists of the form
prescribed by the global theory.  In fact, the global argument forces $L$
to be tempered, but a local argument shows that if nonzero it is not.
By the vanishing of the obstruction,
the fundamental lemma is seen to hold on the full spherical Hecke algebra.


\subsection{Smooth Transfer}

Langlands's book on the stabilization of the trace formula contains
two separate conjectures.  The first is the transfer of smooth
functions.  The second is the fundamental lemma.  An important result
of Waldspurger links the two conjectures, by proving that the
fundamental lemma implies the transfer of smooth functions.  
His key local lemma shows how to obtain simultaneous control over the
orbital integrals of test functions $f$ and the orbital integrals of
their Fourier transform $\hat f$~\cite[Prop.~8.2]{W}.  
In view of the uncertainty principle, it is a remarkable feat to
control both $f$ and $\hat f$ as he does.
% push up against the limits imposed by the
%uncertainty principle.
%is generally deemed nearly impossible by the
% Prop 8.2, p198.
His proof is a global argument, based on a stable Poisson summation trace
formula.  The key local lemma allows Waldspurger to pick global test
functions for which the comparison of trace formulas asserts a
local identity: the Fourier transform of a semisimple
$\kappa$-orbit on $G$ equals the Fourier transform of the corresponding
stable orbit on $H$.  By a purely local argument, this identity of Fourier
transforms of orbits implies smooth transfer.

\subsection{Weighted orbital integrals}

\subsection{Transfer to Characteristic Zero}

The fundamental lemma for nonarchimedean local fields in
characteristic zero can be deduced from the fundamental lemma in
positive characteristic [Wald], [CHL].  Cluckers and Loeser develop a
general abstract theory of integration as a conglomerate of primitive
operations such as taking the volume of a ball of given radius,
enumerating points on a variety over the residue field, summing a
hypergeometric $q$-series, and making a change of variables.  Since each
of the primitive operations manifestly depends only on the residue
field and not on the field itself, their theory allows many identities
of integrals to be transferred from one field to another with the same
residue field.  The FL lemma is a collection of identities that fall
within the scope of this theory.
