The glpk/ directory contains the code for the linear programming part of the Flyspeck project.  The main file is lpproc.ml.

Let me apologize for the organization of the files in the glpk
directory.  There are a few calculations that I never finished and
until then things are in tentative form.

The file book_code/sphere.ml defines dih_y that is used by lpproc.ml.

Files in the /tmp directory for the processing of the linear programs.

To use this directory, you will need to download the archive of tame graphs from
http://weyl.math.pitt.edu/hanoi2009/Kepler/Kepler.  
This is the file that I call tame_graph.txt, or (archiveraw).

The part of lpproc.ml from about lines 448 to about 553 is an
experiment that has been added without much debugging.  Also lines 735
to the end are quite experimental.
