The glpk/ directory contains the code for the linear programming part
of the Flyspeck project.  The main file is build_lp.hl.

Various files are written to the /tmp directory, during processing of linear programs.

This is now called string_archive.txt and has been added to the flyspeck repository
in the formal_graph/archive directory.
