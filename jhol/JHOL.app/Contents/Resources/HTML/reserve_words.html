<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Add given strings to the set of reserved words.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Certain identifiers in HOL are reserved, e.g. `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>if</SPAN>', `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>let</SPAN>' and `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|</SPAN>',
meaning that they are special to the parser and cannot be used as ordinary
identifiers. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>reserve_words l</SPAN> adds all strings in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l</SPAN> to the list of
reserved identifiers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, regardless of whether the given strings were already reserved.
