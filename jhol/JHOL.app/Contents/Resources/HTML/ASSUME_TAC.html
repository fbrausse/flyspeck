<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Adds an assumption to a goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- u</SPAN>, and a goal, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME_TAC th</SPAN>
adds <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>u</SPAN> to the assumptions of the goal.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
         A ?- t
    ==============  ASSUME_TAC (A' |- u)
     A u {u} ?- t
</PRE></DIV>
Note that unless <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A'</SPAN> is a subset of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>, this tactic is invalid. The
new assumption is unlabelled; for a named assumption use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>LABEL_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
One can add an external theorem as an assumption if desired, for example so
that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]</SPAN> will automatically apply it. But usually the theorem
is derived from some theorem-tactical, e.g. by discharging the antecedent of an
implication or doing forward inference on another assumption. For example iff
faced with the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `0 = x ==> f(2 * x) = f(x * f(x))`;;
</PRE></DIV>
one might not want to just do <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISCH_TAC</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_TAC</SPAN> because the
assumption will be <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`0 = x`</SPAN>. One can swap it first then put it on the
assumptions by:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(DISCH_THEN(ASSUME_TAC o SYM));;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`x = 0`]

  `f (2 * x) = f (x * f x)`
</PRE></DIV>
after which the goal can very easily be solved:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(ASM_REWRITE_TAC[MULT_CLAUSES]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Useful as a parameter to various theorem-tacticals such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>X_CHOOSE_THEN</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISCH_THEN</SPAN> etc. when it is simply desired to add the theorem that has been
deduced to the assumptions rather than used further at once.
