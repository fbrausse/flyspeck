<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Constructs a generalized abstraction.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a pair of terms <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, the call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_gabs(s,t)</SPAN> constructs a
canonical `generalized abstraction' that is thought of as `some function that
always maps <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>'. In the case where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> is a variable, the result is an
ordinary abstraction as constructed by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_abs</SPAN>. In other cases, the canonical
composite structure is created. Note that the logical construct is welldefined
even if there is no function mapping <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, and this function will
always succeed, even if the resulting structure is not really useful.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is a simple abstraction:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # mk_gabs(`x:bool`,`~x`);;
  val it : term = `\x. ~x`
</PRE></DIV>
and here are a couple of potentially useful generalized ones:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # mk_gabs(`(x:num,y:num)`,`x + y + 1`);;
  val it : term = `\(x,y). x + y + 1`

  # mk_gabs(`CONS (h:num) t`,`if h = 0 then t else CONS h t`);;
  val it : term = `\CONS h t. if h = 0 then t else CONS h t`
</PRE></DIV>
while here is a vacuous one about which nothing interesting will be
proved, because there is no welldefined function that always maps <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x + y</SPAN> to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # mk_gabs(`x + y:num`,`x:num`);;
  val it : term = `\(x + y). x`
</PRE></DIV>
