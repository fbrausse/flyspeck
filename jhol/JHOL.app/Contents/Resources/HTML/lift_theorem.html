<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Lifts a theorem to quotient type from representing type.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_theorem</SPAN> should be applied (i) a pair of type bijection
theorems as returned by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type</SPAN> for equivalence classes over a
binary relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN>, (ii) a triple of theorems asserting that the relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN>
is reflexive, symmetric and transitive in exactly the following form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- !x. R x x
  |- !x y. R x y <=> R y x
  |- !x y z. R x y /\ R y z ==> R x z
</PRE></DIV>
and (iii) the list of theorems returned as the second component of
the pairs from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_function</SPAN> for all functions that should be mapped.
Finally, it is then applied to a theorem about the representing type. It
automatically maps it over to the quotient type, appropriately modifying
quantification over the representing type into quantification over the new
quotient type, and replacing functions over the representing type with their
corresponding lifted counterparts. Note that all variables should be bound by
quantifiers; these may be existential or universal but if any types involve the
representing type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty</SPAN> it must be just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty</SPAN> and not a composite or
higher-order type such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty->rty</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty#num</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if any of the input theorems are malformed (e.g. symmetry stated with
implication instead of equivalence) or fail to correspond (e.g. different
polymorphic type variables in the type bijections and the equivalence theorem).
Otherwise it will not fail, but if used improperly may not map the theorem
across cleanly.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This is a continuation of the example in the documentation entries for
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_function</SPAN>, where a type of finite multisets is
defined as the quotient of the type of lists by a suitable equivalence relation
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>multisame</SPAN>. We can take the theorems asserting that this is indeed reflexive,
symmetric and transitive:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let [MULTISAME_REFL;MULTISAME_SYM;MULTISAME_TRANS] = (CONJUNCTS o prove)
     (`(!l:(A)list. multisame l l) /\
       (!l l':(A)list. multisame l l' <=> multisame l' l) /\
       (!l1 l2 l3:(A)list.
            multisame l1 l2 /\ multisame l2 l3 ==> multisame l1 l3)`,
      REWRITE_TAC[multisame] THEN MESON_TAC[]);;
</PRE></DIV>
and can now lift theorems. For example, we know that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>APPEND</SPAN> is
itself associative, and so in particular:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let MULTISAME_APPEND_ASSOC = prove
     (`!l m n. multisame (APPEND l (APPEND m n)) (APPEND (APPEND l m) n)`,
      REWRITE_TAC[APPEND_ASSOC; MULTISAME_REFL]);;
</PRE></DIV>
and we can easily show how list multiplicity interacts with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>APPEND</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let LISTMULT_APPEND = prove
     (`!a l m. listmult a (APPEND l m) = listmult a l + listmult a m`,
      REWRITE_TAC[listmult; LENGTH_APPEND; FILTER_APPEND]);;
</PRE></DIV>
These theorems and any others like them can now be lifted to equivalence
classes:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let [MULTIPLICITY_MUNION;MUNION_ASSOC] =
        map (lift_theorem (multiset_abs,multiset_rep)
                          (MULTISAME_REFL,MULTISAME_SYM,MULTISAME_TRANS)
                          [multiplicity_th; munion_th])
            [LISTMULT_APPEND; MULTISAME_APPEND_ASSOC];;
  val ( MULTIPLICITY_MUNION ) : thm =
    |- !a l m.
           multiplicity a (munion l m) = multiplicity a l + multiplicity a m
  val ( MUNION_ASSOC ) : thm =
    |- !l m n. munion l (munion m n) = munion (munion l m) n
</PRE></DIV>
