<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Conversion to eliminate one free conditional subterm.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`....(if p then x else y)...`</SPAN> containing a free
conditional subterm, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>COND_ELIM_CONV</SPAN> returns a theorem asserting its
equivalence to a term with the conditional eliminated:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- ....(if p then x else y).... <=>
     (p ==> ....x....) /\ (~p ==> ....y....)
</PRE></DIV>
If the term contains many free conditional subterms, a topmost one will be
used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if there are no free conditional subterms.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
We can prove the little equivalence noted by Dijkstra in EWD1176 automatically:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_ARITH `!a b:real. a + b >= max a b <=> a >= &amp;0 /\ b >= &amp;0`;;
  val it : thm = |- !a b. a + b >= max a b <=> a >= &amp;0 /\ b >= &amp;0
</PRE></DIV>
However, if our automated tools were unfamiliar with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>max</SPAN>, we might expand its
definition (theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real_max</SPAN>) and then eliminate the resulting conditional by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>COND_ELIM_CONV</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # COND_ELIM_CONV `a + b >= (if a <= b then b else a) <=> a >= &amp;0 /\ b >= &amp;0`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (a + b >= (if a <= b then b else a) <=> a >= &amp;0 /\ b >= &amp;0) <=>
       (a <= b ==> (a + b >= b <=> a >= &amp;0 /\ b >= &amp;0)) /\
       (~(a <= b) ==> (a + b >= a <=> a >= &amp;0 /\ b >= &amp;0))
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Eliminating conditionals as a prelude to other automated proof steps that are
not equipped to handle them.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Note that logically it should only be necessary for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> to be free in the whole
term, not the two branches <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>y</SPAN>. However, as an artifact of the current
implementation, we need them to be free too. The more sophisticated
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONDS_ELIM_CONV</SPAN> handles this better.
