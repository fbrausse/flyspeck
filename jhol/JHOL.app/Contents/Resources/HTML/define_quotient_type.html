<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Defines a quotient type based on given equivalence relation.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type "qty" ("abs","rep") `R`</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R:A->A->bool</SPAN>
is a binary relation, defines a new ``quotient type'' <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:qty</SPAN> and two new
functions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>abs:(A->bool)->qty</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rep:qty->(A->bool)</SPAN>, and returns the pair
of theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- abs(rep a) = a</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- (?x. r = R x) <=> rep(abs r) = r</SPAN>.
Normally, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN> will be an equivalence relation (reflexive, symmetric and
transitive), in which case the quotient type will be in bijection with the set
of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN>-equivalence classes.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if there is already a type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>qty</SPAN> or if either <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>abs</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rep</SPAN> is already
in use as a constant.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
For some purposes we may want to use ``multisets'' or ``bags''. These are like
sets in that order is irrelevant, but like lists in that multiplicity is
counted. We can define a type of finite multisets as a quotient of lists by the
relation:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let multisame = new_definition
     `multisame l1 l2 <=> !a:A. FILTER (\x. x = a) l1 = FILTER (\x. x = a) l2`;;
</PRE></DIV>
as follows:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let multiset_abs,multiset_rep =
      define_quotient_type "multiset" ("multiset_of_list","list_of_multiset")
      `multisame:A list -> A list -> bool`;;
  val multiset_abs : thm = |- multiset_of_list (list_of_multiset a) = a
  val multiset_rep : thm =
    |- (?x. r = multisame x) <=> list_of_multiset (multiset_of_list r) = r
</PRE></DIV>
For development of this example, see the documentation entries for
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_function</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_theorem</SPAN> (in that order). Similarly we could define a
type of finite sets by:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  define_quotient_type "finiteset" ("finiteset_of_list","list_of_finiteset")
   `\l1 l2. !a:A. MEM a l1 <=> MEM a l2`;;
  val it : thm * thm =
    (|- finiteset_of_list (list_of_finiteset a) = a,
     |- (?x. r = (\l1 l2. !a. MEM a l1 <=> MEM a l2) x) <=>
        list_of_finiteset (finiteset_of_list r) = r)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Convenient creation of quotient structures. Using related functions
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_function</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_theorem</SPAN>, functions, relations and theorems can be
lifted from the representing type to the type of equivalence classes. As well
as those shown above, characteristic applications are the definition of
rationals as equivalence classes of pairs of integers under
cross-multiplication, or of `directions' as equivalence classes of vectors
under parallelism.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN> is not an equivalence relation, the basic operation of
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type</SPAN> will work equally well, but the usefulness of the new
type will be limited. In particular, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_function</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_theorem</SPAN> may not
be usable.
