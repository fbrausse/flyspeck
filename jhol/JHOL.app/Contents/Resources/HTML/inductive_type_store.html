<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
List of inductive types defined with corresponding theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The reference variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>inductive_type_store</SPAN> holds an association list that
associates with the name of each inductive type defined so far (e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"list"</SPAN>
or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"1"</SPAN>) a triple: the number of constructors, the induction theorem and the
recursion theorem for it. The two theorems are exactly of the form returned by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_type</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This example is characteristic:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # assoc "list" (!inductive_type_store);;
  val it : int * thm * thm =
    (2, |- !P. P [] /\ (!a0 a1. P a1 ==> P (CONS a0 a1)) ==> (!x. P x),
     |- !NIL' CONS'.
            ?fn. fn [] = NIL' /\
                 (!a0 a1. fn (CONS a0 a1) = CONS' a0 a1 (fn a1)))
</PRE></DIV>
while the following shows that there is an entry for the Boolean
type, for the sake of regularity, even though it is not normally considered an
inductive type:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # assoc "bool" (!inductive_type_store);;
  val it : int * thm * thm =
    (2, |- !P. P F /\ P T ==> (!x. P x), |- !a b. ?f. f F = a /\ f T = b)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This list is mainly for internal use. For example it is employed by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> to
automatically prove the existence of recursive functions over inductive types.
Users may find the information helpful to implement their own proof tools.
However, while the list may be inspected, it should not be modified explicitly
or there may be unwanted side-effects on <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN>.
