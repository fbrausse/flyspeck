<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Add an assumption with a named label to a goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>, the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>LABEL_TAC "name" th</SPAN> will add <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> as a new
hypothesis, just as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME_TAC</SPAN> does, but will also give it <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>name</SPAN> as a label.
The name will show up when the goal is printed, and can be used to refer to the
theorem in tactics like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>USE_THEN</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REMOVE_THEN</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, though may be invalid if the theorem has assumptions that are not
a subset of those in the goal, up to alpha-equivalence.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we want to prove that a binary relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><<=</SPAN> that is antisymmetric and
has a strong wellfoundedness property is also antisymmetric and transitive, and
hence a wellorder:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `(!x y. x <<= y /\ y <<= x ==> x = y) /\
       (!s. ~(s = {}) ==> ?a:A. a IN s /\ !x. x IN s ==> a <<= x)
       ==> (!x y. x <<= y \/ y <<= x) /\
           (!x y z. x <<= y /\ y <<= z ==> x <<= z)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
We might start by putting the two hypotheses on the assumption list
with intuitive names:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(DISCH_THEN(CONJUNCTS_THEN2 (LABEL_TAC "antisym") (LABEL_TAC "wo")));;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`!x y. x <<= y /\ y <<= x ==> x = y`] (antisym)
   1 [`!s. ~(s = {}) ==> (?a. a IN s /\ (!x. x IN s ==> a <<= x))`] (wo)

  `(!x y. x <<= y \/ y <<= x) /\ (!x y z. x <<= y /\ y <<= z ==> x <<= z)`
</PRE></DIV>
Now we break down the goal a bit
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT STRIP_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 2 subgoals (2 total)

   0 [`!x y. x <<= y /\ y <<= x ==> x = y`] (antisym)
   1 [`!s. ~(s = {}) ==> (?a. a IN s /\ (!x. x IN s ==> a <<= x))`] (wo)
   2 [`x <<= y`]
   3 [`y <<= z`]

  `x <<= z`

   0 [`!x y. x <<= y /\ y <<= x ==> x = y`] (antisym)
   1 [`!s. ~(s = {}) ==> (?a. a IN s /\ (!x. x IN s ==> a <<= x))`] (wo)

  `x <<= y \/ y <<= x`
</PRE></DIV>
We want to specialize the wellordering assumption to an appropriate
set for each case, and we can identify it using the label <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>wo</SPAN>; the problem is
then simple set-theoretic reasoning:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(USE_THEN "wo" (MP_TAC o SPEC `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x:A,y:A</SPAN>`) THEN SET_TAC[]);;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`!x y. x <<= y /\ y <<= x ==> x = y`] (antisym)
   1 [`!s. ~(s = {}) ==> (?a. a IN s /\ (!x. x IN s ==> a <<= x))`] (wo)
   2 [`x <<= y`]
   3 [`y <<= z`]

  `x <<= z`
</PRE></DIV>
Similarly for the other one:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(USE_THEN "wo" (MP_TAC o SPEC `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x:A,y:A,z:A</SPAN>`) THEN SET_TAC[]);;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Convenient for referring to an assumption explicitly, just as in mathematics
books one sometimes marks a theorem with an asterisk or dagger, then refers to
it using that symbol.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
There are other ways of identifying assumptions than by label, but they are not
always convenient. For example, explicitly doing <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME `asm`</SPAN> is cumbersome
if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>asm</SPAN> is large, and using its number in the assumption list can make proofs
very brittle under later changes.
