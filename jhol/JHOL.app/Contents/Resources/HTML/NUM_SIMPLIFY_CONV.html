<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>NUM_SIMPLIFY_CONV : conv</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Eliminates predecessor, cutoff subtraction, even and odd, division and modulus.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a term, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUM_SIMPLIFY_CONV</SPAN> tries to get rid of instances of
the natural number operators <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PRE</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DIV</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MOD</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>-</SPAN> (which is cutoff
subtraction), as well as the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EVEN</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ODD</SPAN> predicates, by rephrasing
properties in terms of multiplication and addition, adding new variables if
necessary. Some attempt is made to introduce quantifiers so that they are
effectively universally quantified. However, the input formula should be in NNF
for this aspect to be completely reliable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Should never fail, but in obscure situations may leave some instance of the
troublesome operators (for example, if they are mapped over a list instead of
simply applied).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # NUM_SIMPLIFY_CONV `~(n = 0) ==> PRE(n) + 1 = n`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- ~(n = 0) ==> PRE n + 1 = n <=>
       (!m. ~(n = SUC m) /\ (~(m = 0) \/ ~(n = 0)) \/ n = 0 \/ m + 1 = n)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Not really intended for most users, but a prelude inside several automated
routines such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ARITH_RULE</SPAN>. It is because of this preprocessing step that
such rules can handle these troublesome operators to some extent, e.g.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ARITH_RULE `~(n = 0) ==> n DIV 3 < n`;;
  val it : thm = |- ~(n = 0) ==> n DIV 3 < n
</PRE></DIV>
