<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>PURE_REWRITE_TAC : thm list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a goal with only the given list of rewrites.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> behaves in the same way as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, but
without the effects of the built-in tautologies.  The order in which
the given theorems are applied is an implementation matter and the user
should not depend on any ordering. For more information on rewriting
strategies see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> does not fail, but it can diverge in certain
situations; in such cases <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> may be used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This tactic is useful when the built-in tautologies are not required as
rewrite equations. It is sometimes useful in making more time-efficient
replacements according to equations for which it is clear that no extra
reduction via tautology will be needed. (The difference in efficiency
is only apparent, however, in quite large examples.)

<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> advances goals but solves them less frequently than
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>; to be precise, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> only solves goals
which are rewritten to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`T`</SPAN> (i.e. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TRUTH</SPAN>) without recourse to any
other tautologies.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
It might be necessary, say for subsequent application of an induction
hypothesis, to resist reducing a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`b = T`</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`b`</SPAN>.
