<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Returns the current set of primitive definitions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>definitions()</SPAN> returns the current list of basic definitions made in
the HOL Light kernel.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This is a more logically primitive list than the one maintained in the list
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!the_definitions</SPAN>, and is intended mainly for auditing a proof development
that uses axioms to ensure that no axioms and definitions clash. Under normal
circumstances axioms are not used and so this information is not needed.
Definitions returned by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>definitions()</SPAN> are in their primitive equational form,
and include everything defined in the kernel. By contrast, those in the list
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!the_definitions</SPAN> are often quantified and eta-expanded, and the list may be
incomplete since it is only maintained outside the logical kernel as a
convenience.
