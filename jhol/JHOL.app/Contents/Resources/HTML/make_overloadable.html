<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Makes a symbol overloadable within the specified type skeleton.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
HOL Light allows the same identifier to denote several different underlying
constants, with the choice being determined by types and/or an order of
priority (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prioritize_overload</SPAN>). However, any identifier <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ident</SPAN> to be
overloaded must first be declared overloadable using
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>make_overloadable "ident" `:ty`</SPAN>. The ``type skeleton'' argument <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`:ty`</SPAN> is
the most general type that the various instances may have.

The type skeleton can simply be a type variable, in which case any type is
acceptable, but it is good practice to constrain it where possible to allow
more information to be inferred during typechecking. For example, the symbol
`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>' has the type skeleton <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`:A->A->A`</SPAN> (as you can find out by examining the
list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>the_overload_skeletons</SPAN>) indicating that it is always overloaded to a
binary operator that returns and element of the same type as its two arguments.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the symbol has previously been made overloadable but with a different
type skeleton.

<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # make_overloadable "<=" `:A->A->bool`;;
