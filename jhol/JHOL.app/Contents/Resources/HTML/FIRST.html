<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>FIRST : tactic list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies the first tactic in a tactic list that succeeds.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a list of tactics <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[t1;...;tn]</SPAN>, and a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>, the tactical
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIRST</SPAN> tries applying the tactics to the goal until one succeeds. If the
first tactic which succeeds is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>, then the effect is the same as just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>.
Thus <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIRST</SPAN> effectively behaves as follows:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   FIRST [t1;...;tn] = t1 ORELSE ... ORELSE tn
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
The application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIRST</SPAN> to a tactic list never fails. The resulting
tactic fails iff all the component tactics do when applied to the goal,
or if the tactic list is empty.
