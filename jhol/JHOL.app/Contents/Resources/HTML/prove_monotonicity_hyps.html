<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Attempt to prove monotonicity hypotheses of theorem automatically.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- t</SPAN>, the rule <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_monotonicity_hyps</SPAN> attempts to prove
and remove all hypotheses that are not equations, by breaking them down and
repeatedly using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MONO_TAC</SPAN>. Any that are equations or are not automatically
provable will be left as they are.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails but may have no effect.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Normally, this kind of reasoning is automated by the inductive definitions
package, so explicit use of this tactic is rare.
