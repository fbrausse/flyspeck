<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Simplify conclusion of goal once by conditional contextual rewriting.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- g</SPAN>, the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_SIMP_TAC thl</SPAN> returns a new
goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- g'</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g'</SPAN> results from applying the theorems in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thl</SPAN> as
(conditional) rewrite rules, as well as built-in simplifications (see
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_convs</SPAN>). For more details on this kind of
conditional rewriting, see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_CONV</SPAN>. The <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE</SPAN> prefix indicates that
the first applicable terms in a toplevel term will be simplified once only.
Moreover, in contrast to the other simplification tactics, any unsolved
subgoals arising from conditions on rewrites will be split off as new goals,
allowing simplification to proceed more interactively.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, though may not change the goal if no simplifications are
applicable.
