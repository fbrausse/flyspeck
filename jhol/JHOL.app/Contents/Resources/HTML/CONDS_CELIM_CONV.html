<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Remove all conditional expressions from a Boolean formula.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a Boolean term, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONDS_CELIM_CONV</SPAN> identifies subterms that are
conditional expressions of the form `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>if p then x else y</SPAN>', and eliminates
them. First they are ``pulled out'' as far as possible, e.g.
from `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f (if p then x else y)</SPAN>' to `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>if p then f(x) else f(y)</SPAN>' and so on. When
a quantifier that binds one of the variables in the expression is reached, the
subterm is of Boolean type, say `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>if p then q else r</SPAN>', and it is replaced by a
propositional equivalent of the form `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(~p \/ q) /\ (p \/ r)</SPAN>'.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, but will just return a reflexive theorem if the term is not
Boolean.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # CONDS_CELIM_CONV `y <= z ==> !x. (if x <= y then y else x) <= z`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- y <= z ==> (!x. (if x <= y then y else x) <= z) <=>
       y <= z ==> (!x. (~(x <= y) \/ y <= z) /\ (x <= y \/ x <= z))
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Mostly for initial normalization in automated rules, but may be helpful for
other uses.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONDS_ELIM_CONV</SPAN> is functionally similar, but will do the final
propositional splitting in a ``disjunctive'' rather than ``conjunctive'' way.
The disjunctive way is usually better when the term will subsequently be passed
to a refutation procedure, whereas the conjunctive form is better for
non-refutation procedures. In each case, the policy is changed in an
appropriate way after passing through quantifiers.
