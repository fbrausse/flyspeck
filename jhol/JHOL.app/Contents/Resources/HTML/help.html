<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Displays help on a given identifier in the system.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>help "s"</SPAN> will attempt to display the help file associated with a
particular identifier <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> in the system. If there is no entry for identifier
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN>, the call responds instead with some possibly helpful suggestions as to
what you might have meant, based on a simple `edit distance' criterion.

The built-in help files are stored in the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Help</SPAN> subdirectory of HOL Light.
Users can add additional locations by modifying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>help_path</SPAN>. Normally the help
file for an identifier <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>name</SPAN> would be called <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>name.doc</SPAN>, but there are a few
exceptions, because some identifiers have characters that cannot be put in
filenames and some platforms like Cygwin have inadequate case sensitivity.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is a successful call:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # help "lhs";;
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  lhs : term -> term

  SYNOPSIS

  DESCRIPTION

  FAILURE CONDITIONS

  EXAMPLES


    # lhs `2 + 2 = 4`;;
    val it : term = `2 + 2`

</PRE></DIV>
and here is one for a non-existent identifier:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # help "IMP_TAC";;
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  No help found for "IMP_TAC"; did you mean:

  help "SIMP_TAC";;
  help "MP_TAC";;
  help "IMP_TRANS";;
