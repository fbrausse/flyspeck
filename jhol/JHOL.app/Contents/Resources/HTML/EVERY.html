<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>EVERY : tactic list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Sequentially applies all the tactics in a given list of tactics.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a list of tactics <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[t1; ... ;tn]</SPAN>, and a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>, the tactical
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EVERY</SPAN> applies each tactic in sequence to every
subgoal generated by the previous one. This can be represented as:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   EVERY [t1;...;tn] = t1 THEN ... THEN tn
</PRE></DIV>
If the tactic list is empty, the resulting tactic has no effect.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
The application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EVERY</SPAN> to a tactic list never fails. The resulting
tactic fails iff any of the component tactics do.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
It is possible to use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EVERY</SPAN> instead of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>THEN</SPAN>, but probably
stylistically inferior. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EVERY</SPAN> is more useful when applied to a list of
tactics generated by a function.
