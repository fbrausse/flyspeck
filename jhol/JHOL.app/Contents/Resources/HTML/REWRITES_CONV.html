<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Apply a prioritized conversion net to the term at the top level.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The underlying machinery in rewriting and simplification assembles
(conditional) rewrite rules and other conversions into a net, including a
priority number so that, for example, pure rewrites get applied before
conditional rewrites. If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net</SPAN> is such a net (for example, constructed using
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_rewrites</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net_of_thm</SPAN>), then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITES_CONV net</SPAN> is a conversion that
uses all those conversions at the toplevel to attempt to rewrite the term. If a
conditional rewrite is applied, the resulting theorem will have an assumption.
This is the primitive operation that performs HOL Light rewrite steps.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails when applied to the term if none of the conversions in the net are
applicable.
