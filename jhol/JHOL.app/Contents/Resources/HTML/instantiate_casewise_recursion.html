<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Instantiate the general scheme for a recursive function existence assertion.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>instantiate_casewise_recursion</SPAN> should be applied to an
existentially quantified term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`?f. def_1[f] /\ ... /\ def_n[f]`</SPAN>,
where each clause <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>def_i</SPAN> is a universally quantified equation with an
application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> to arguments on the left-hand side. The idea is that these
clauses define the action of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> on arguments of various kinds, for example on
an empty list and nonempty list:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  ?f. (f [] = a) /\ (!h t. CONS h t = k[f,h,t])
</PRE></DIV>
or on even numbers and odd numbers:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  ?f. (!n. f(2 * n) = a[f,n]) /\ (!n. f(2 * n + 1) = b[f,n])
</PRE></DIV>
The returned value is a theorem whose conclusion matches the input term, with
an assumption sufficient for the existence assertion. This is not normally in a
very convenient form for the user.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails only if the definition is malformed. However it is possible that for an
inadmissible definition the assumption of the theorem may not hold.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This is seldom a convenient function for users. Normally, use
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> to prove something like this while
attempting to discharge the side-conditions automatically, or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> to
actually make a definition. In situations where the automatic discharge of the
side-conditions fails, one may prefer instead
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pure_prove_recursive_function_exists</SPAN>. The even more minimal
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>instantiate_casewise_recursion</SPAN> is for the rare cases where one wants to force
no processing at all of the side-conditions to be undertaken.
