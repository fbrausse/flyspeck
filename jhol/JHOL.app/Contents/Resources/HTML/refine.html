<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>refine : refinement -&gt; goalstack</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies a refinement to the current goalstack.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>refine r</SPAN> applies the refinement <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>r</SPAN> to the current goalstate, adding
the resulting goalstate at the head of the current goalstack list. (A goalstate
consists of a list of subgoals as well as justification and metavariable
information.)

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the refinement fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Most users will not want to handle refinements explicitly. Usually one just
applies a tactic to the first goal in a goalstate.
