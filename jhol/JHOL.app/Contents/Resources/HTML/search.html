<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Search the database of theorems according to query patterns.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>search</SPAN> function is intended to locate a desired theorem by searching
based on term patterns or names. The database of theorems to be searched is
held in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>theorems</SPAN>, which initially contains all theorems individually bound to
OCaml identifiers in the main system, and can be augmented or otherwise
modified by the user. (See in particular the update script in
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>update_database.ml</SPAN> which creates a database according to the current
OCaml environment.)

The input to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>search</SPAN> is a list of terms that are treated as patterns.
Normally, a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pat</SPAN> is interpreted as a search for `a theorem with any
subterm of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pat</SPAN>', e.g. a pattern <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x + y</SPAN> for any subterm of the form
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s + t</SPAN>. However, several syntax functions create composite terms that are
interpreted specially by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>search</SPAN>:

\begin{itemize}

\item <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>omit pat</SPAN> --- Search for theorems {\em not} satisfying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pat</SPAN>

\item <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>exactly `t`</SPAN> --- Search for theorems with subterms alpha-equivalent to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> (not just of the general form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>)

\item <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>name "str"</SPAN> --- Search for theorems whose name contains <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>str</SPAN> as a
substring.

\end{itemize}

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Search for theorems with a subterm of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s <= t / u</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # search [`x <= y / z`];;
  val it : (string * thm) list =
    [("RAT_LEMMA4",
      |- &amp;0 < y1 /\ &amp;0 < y2 ==> (x1 / y1 <= x2 / y2 <=> x1 * y2 <= x2 * y1));
     ("REAL_LE_DIV", |- !x y. &amp;0 <= x /\ &amp;0 <= y ==> &amp;0 <= x / y);
     ("REAL_LE_DIV2_EQ", |- !x y z. &amp;0 < z ==> (x / z <= y / z <=> x <= y));
     ("REAL_LE_RDIV_EQ", |- !x y z. &amp;0 < z ==> (x <= y / z <=> x * z <= y));
     ("SUM_BOUND_GEN",
      |- !s t b.
             FINITE s /\ ~(s = {}) /\ (!x. x IN s ==> f x <= b / &amp;(CARD s))
             ==> sum s f <= b)]
</PRE></DIV>
Search for theorems whose name contains <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"CROSS"</SPAN> and whose conclusion involves
the cardinality function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CARD</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # search [name "CROSS"; `CARD`];;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : (string * thm) list =
    [("CARD_CROSS",
      |- !s t. FINITE s /\ FINITE t ==> CARD (s CROSS t) = CARD s * CARD t)]
</PRE></DIV>
Search for theorems that involve finiteness of the image of a set under a
function, but also do not involve logical equivalence:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # search [`FINITE(IMAGE f s)`; omit `(<=>)`];;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : (string * thm) list =
    [("FINITE_IMAGE", |- !f s. FINITE s ==> FINITE (IMAGE f s))]
</PRE></DIV>
