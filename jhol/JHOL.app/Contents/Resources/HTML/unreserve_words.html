<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Remove given strings from the set of reserved words.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Certain identifiers in HOL are reserved, e.g. `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>if</SPAN>', `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>let</SPAN>' and `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|</SPAN>',
meaning that they are special to the parser and cannot be used as ordinary
identifiers. The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>unreserve_words l</SPAN> removes all strings in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l</SPAN> from the
list of reserved identifiers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, regardless of whether the given strings were in fact reserved.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
The initial set of reserved words in HOL Light should be unreserved only with
great care, since then various elementary constructs may fail to parse.
