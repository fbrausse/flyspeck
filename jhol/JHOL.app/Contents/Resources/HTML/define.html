<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Defines a general recursive function.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> should be applied to a conjunction of `definitional'
clauses <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`def_1[f] /\ ... /\ def_n[f]`</SPAN> for some variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN>, where each
clause <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>def_i</SPAN> is a universally quantified equation with an application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN>
to arguments on the left-hand side. The idea is that these clauses define the
action of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> on arguments of various kinds, for example on an empty list and
nonempty list:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  (f [] = a) /\ (!h t. CONS h t = k[f,h,t])
</PRE></DIV>
or on even numbers and odd numbers:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  (!n. f(2 * n) = a[f,n]) /\ (!n. f(2 * n + 1) = b[f,n])
</PRE></DIV>
The <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> function attempts to prove that there is indeed a function
satisfying all these properties, and if it succeeds it defines a new function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> and returns the input term with the variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> replaced by the newly
defined constant.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the definition is malformed or if some of the necessary conditions for
the definition to be admissible cannot be proved automatically, or if there is
already a constant of the given name.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This is a `multifactorial' function:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # define
      `multifactorial m n =
          if m = 0 then 1
          else if n <= m then n else n * multifactorial m (n - m)`;;
  val it : thm =
  |- multifactorial m n =
     (if m = 0 then 1 else if n <= m then n else n * multifactorial m (n - m))
</PRE></DIV>
Note that it fails without the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>m = 0</SPAN> guard because then there's no reason
to suppose that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n - m</SPAN> decreases and hence the recursion is apparently
illfounded. Perhaps a more surprising example is the Collatz function:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # define
     `!n. collatz(n) = if n <= 1 then n
                       else if EVEN(n) then collatz(n DIV 2)
                       else collatz(3 * n + 1)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
Note that the definition was made successfully because there provably is a
function satisfying these recursion equations, notwithstanding the fact that it
is unknown whether the recursion is wellfounded. (Tail-recursive functions are
always logically consistent, though they may not have any useful provable
properties.)

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Assuming the definition is well-formed and the constant name is unused, failure
indicates that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> was unable to prove one or both of the following two
properties: (i) the clauses are not mutually inconsistent (more than one clause
could apply to some arguments, and the results are not obviously the same), or
(ii) the definition is recursive and no ordering justifying the recursion could
be arrived at by the automated heuristic. In order to make progress in such
cases, try applying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN> to the same definition
with existential quantification over <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN>, to see the unproven side-conditions.
An example is in the documentation for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN>.
