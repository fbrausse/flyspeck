<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Resolves an implication with the assumptions of a goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN> is the basic building block for resolution in HOL.
This is not full higher-order, or even first-order, resolution with
unification, but simply one way simultaneous pattern-matching (resulting in
term and type instantiation) of the antecedent of an implicative theorem to the
conclusion of another theorem (the candidate antecedent).

Given a theorem-tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> and a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>, the theorem-tactical
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN> produces a tactic that, when applied to a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- g</SPAN> attempts
to match each antecedent <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ui</SPAN> to each assumption <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>aj |- aj</SPAN> in the assumptions
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>.  If the antecedent <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ui</SPAN> of any implication matches the conclusion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>aj</SPAN> of
any assumption, then an instance of the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u {aj} |- vi</SPAN>, called a
`resolvent', is obtained by specialization of the variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>xn</SPAN> and
type instantiation, followed by an application of modus ponens.  There may be
more than one canonical implication and each implication is tried against every
assumption of the goal, so there may be several resolvents (or, indeed, none).

Tactics are produced using the theorem-tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> from all these resolvents
(failures of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> at this stage are filtered out) and these tactics are then
applied in an unspecified sequence to the goal.  That is,
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   IMP_RES_THEN ttac th  (A ?- g)
</PRE></DIV>
has the effect of:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   MAP_EVERY (mapfilter ttac [... ; (Ai u {aj} |- vi) ; ...]) (A ?- g)
</PRE></DIV>
where the theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u {aj} |- vi</SPAN> are all the consequences that
can be drawn by a (single) matching modus-ponens inference from the
assumptions of the goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- g</SPAN> and the implications derived from the supplied
theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>.  The sequence in which the theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u {aj} |- vi</SPAN> are
generated and the corresponding tactics applied is unspecified.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Evaluating <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_RES_THEN ttac th</SPAN> fails if the supplied theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is not an
implication, or if no implications can be derived from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> by the
transformation process involved. Evaluating <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_RES_THEN ttac th (A ?- g)</SPAN>
fails if no assumption of the goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- g</SPAN> can be resolved with the
implication or implications derived from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>. Evaluation also fails if there
are resolvents, but for every resolvent <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u {aj} |- vi</SPAN> evaluating the
application <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac (Ai u {aj} |- vi)</SPAN> fails---that is, if for every resolvent
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> fails to produce a tactic. Finally, failure is propagated if any of the
tactics that are produced from the resolvents by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> fails when applied in
sequence to the goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following example shows a straightforward use of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>IMP_RES_THEN</SPAN> to
infer an equational consequence of the assumptions of a goal, use it
once as a substitution in the conclusion of goal, and then `throw it away'.
Suppose the goal is:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!a n. a + n = a ==> !k. k - n = k`;;
</PRE></DIV>
and we start out with:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC THEN DISCH_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`a + n = a`]

  `!k. k - n = k`
</PRE></DIV>
By using the theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let ADD_INV_0 = ARITH_RULE `!m n. m + n = m ==> n = 0`;;
</PRE></DIV>
the assumption of this goal implies that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> equals <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>0</SPAN>.  A
single-step resolution with this theorem followed by substitution:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(IMP_RES_THEN SUBST1_TAC ADD_INV_0);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`a + n = a`]

  `!k. k - 0 = k`
</PRE></DIV>
Here, a single resolvent <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a + n = a |- n = 0</SPAN> is obtained by
matching the antecedent of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ADD_INV_0</SPAN> to the assumption of the goal.  This is
then used to substitute <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>0</SPAN> for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> in the conclusion of the goal. The goal is
now solvable by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ARITH_TAC</SPAN> (as indeed was the original goal).
