<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Makes a tactic from a conversion.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is a conversion, then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC c</SPAN> is a tactic that applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> to the
goal.  That is, if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> maps a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`g`</SPAN> to the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- g = g'</SPAN>, then the
tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC c</SPAN> reduces a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN> to the subgoal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g'</SPAN>.  More precisely, if
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c `g`</SPAN> returns <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- g = g'</SPAN>, then:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
         A ?- g
     ===============  CONV_TAC c
         A ?- g'
</PRE></DIV>
In the special case where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`g`</SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`T`</SPAN>, the call immediately solves
the goal rather than generating a subgoal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- T</SPAN>. And in a slightly liberal
interpretation of ``conversion'', the conversion may also just prove the goal
and return <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- g</SPAN>, in which case again the goal will be completely solved.

Note that in all cases the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> should return a theorem whose
assumptions are also among the assumptions of the goal (normally, the
conversion will returns a theorem with no assumptions). <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC</SPAN> does not
fail if this is not the case, but the resulting tactic will be invalid, so the
theorem ultimately proved using this tactic will have more assumptions than
those of the original goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC c</SPAN> applied to a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- g</SPAN> fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> fails when applied to the
term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>. The function returned by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC c</SPAN> will also fail if the function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> to a
theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- t = t'</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC</SPAN> can be used to apply simplifications that can't be expressed as
equations (rewrite rules).  For example, a goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `abs(pi - &amp;22 / &amp;7) <= abs(&amp;355 / &amp;113 - &amp;22 / &amp;7)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
can be simplified by rational number arithmetic:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(CONV_TAC REAL_RAT_REDUCE_CONV);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `abs (pi - &amp;22 / &amp;7) <= &amp;1 / &amp;791`
</PRE></DIV>
It is also handy for invoking decision procedures that only have a ``rule''
form, and no special ``tactic'' form. (Indeed, the tactic form can be defined
in terms of the rule form by using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONV_TAC</SPAN>.) For example, the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!x:real. &amp;0 < x ==> &amp;1 / x - &amp;1 / (x + &amp;1) = &amp;1 / (x * (x + &amp;1))`;;
</PRE></DIV>
can be solved by:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(CONV_TAC REAL_FIELD);;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>
