<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>CNF_CONV : conv</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Converts a term already in negation normal form into conjunctive normal form.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a term already in negation normal form (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NNF_CONV</SPAN>),
meaning that all other propositional connectives have been eliminated in favour
of conjunction, disjunction and negation, and negation is only applied to
atomic formulas, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CNF_CONV</SPAN> puts the term into an equivalent conjunctive normal
form, which is a right-associated conjunction of disjunctions without
repetitions. No reduction by subsumption is performed, however, e.g. from
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a /\ (a \/ b)</SPAN> to just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails; non-Boolean terms will just yield a reflexive theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # CNF_CONV `(a /\ b) \/ (a /\ b /\ c) \/ d`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- a /\ b \/ a /\ b /\ c \/ d <=>
       (a \/ d) /\ (a \/ b \/ d) /\ (a \/ c \/ d) /\ (b \/ d) /\ (b \/ c \/ d)
