<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Modifies a variable name to avoid clashes.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>variant avoid v</SPAN> returns a variant of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN>, with the name changed by
adding primes as much as necessary to avoid clashing with any free variables of
the terms in the list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>avoid</SPAN>. Usually <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>avoid</SPAN> is just a list of variables, in
which case <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN> is renamed so as to be different from all of them.

The exact form of the variable name should not be relied on, except that the
original variable will be returned unmodified unless it is free in some term in
the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>avoid</SPAN> list.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>variant l t</SPAN> fails if any term in the list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l</SPAN> is not a variable or if
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> is neither a variable nor a constant.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following shows a few typical cases:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # variant [`y:bool`; `z:bool`] `x:bool`;;
  val it : term = `x`

  # variant [`x:bool`; `x':num`; `x'':num`] `x:bool`;;
  val it : term = `x'`

  # variant [`x:bool`; `x':bool`; `x'':bool`] `x:bool`;;
  val it : term = `x'''`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>variant</SPAN> is extremely useful for complicated derived rules which
need to rename variables to avoid free variable capture while still making the
role of the variable obvious to the user.
