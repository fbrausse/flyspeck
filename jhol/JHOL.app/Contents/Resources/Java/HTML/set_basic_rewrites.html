<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Assign the set of default rewrites used by rewriting and simplification.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The HOL Light rewriter (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> etc.) and simplifier (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN> etc.)
have default sets of (conditional) equations and other conversions that are
applied by default, except in the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_</SPAN> variants. A call to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>extend_basic_rewrites thl</SPAN> sets this to be the list of theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thl</SPAN> (after
processing into rewrite rules by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_rewrites</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Users will most likely want to extend the existing set by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>extend_basic_rewrites</SPAN> rather than completely change it like this.
