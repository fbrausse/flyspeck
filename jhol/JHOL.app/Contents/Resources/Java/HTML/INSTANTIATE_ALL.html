<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Apply a higher-order instantiation to assumptions and conclusion of a theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INSTANTIATE_ALL i t</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN> is an instantiation as returned by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_match</SPAN>, will perform the instantiation indicated by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN> in the conclusion
of the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>: types and terms will be instantiated and the
beta-reductions that are part of higher-order matching will be applied.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails on a valid instantiation.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This is not intended for general use. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PART_MATCH</SPAN> is generally a more
convenient packaging. The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INSTANTIATE</SPAN> is almost the same but does
not instantiate hypotheses and may fail if type variables or term variables
free in the hypotheses make the instantiation impossible.
