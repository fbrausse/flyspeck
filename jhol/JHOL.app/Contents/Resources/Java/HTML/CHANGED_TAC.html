<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Makes a tactic fail if it has no effect.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, the tactical <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CHANGED_TAC</SPAN> gives a new tactic
which is the same as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> if that has any effect, and otherwise fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
The application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CHANGED_TAC</SPAN> to a tactic never fails. The resulting
tactic fails if the basic tactic either fails or has no effect.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Occasionally useful in controlling complicated tactic compositions. Also
sometimes convenient just to check that a step did indeed modify a goal.
