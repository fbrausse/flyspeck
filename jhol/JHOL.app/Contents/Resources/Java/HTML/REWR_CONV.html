<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Uses an instance of a given equation to rewrite a term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> is one of the basic building blocks for the implementation of
rewriting in the HOL system. In particular, the term replacement or rewriting
done by all the built-in rewriting rules and tactics is ultimately done by
applications of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> to appropriate subterms.  The description given
here for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> may therefore be taken as a specification of the atomic
action of replacing equals by equals that is used in all these higher level
rewriting tools.

The first argument to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> is expected to be an equational theorem
which is to be used as a left-to-right rewrite rule.  The general form of this
theorem is:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn]
</PRE></DIV>
where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>xn</SPAN> are all the variables that occur free in the
left-hand side of the conclusion of the theorem but do not occur free in the
assumptions. Any of these variables may also be universally quantified at the
outermost level of the equation, as for example in:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- !x1...xn. t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn]
</PRE></DIV>
Note that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> will also work, but will give a generally
undesirable result (see below), if the right-hand side of the equation contains
free variables that do not also occur free on the left-hand side, as for
example in:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn,y1,...,ym]
</PRE></DIV>
where the variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>y1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ym</SPAN> do not occur free in
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t[x1,...,xn]</SPAN>.

If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is an equational theorem of the kind shown above, then
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th</SPAN> returns a conversion that maps terms of the form
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]</SPAN>, in which the terms <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>e1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>en</SPAN> are free for
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>xn</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, to theorems of the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- t[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn] = u[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]
</PRE></DIV>
That is, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th tm</SPAN> attempts to match the left-hand side of
the rewrite rule <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> to the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>.  If such a match is possible, then
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> returns the corresponding substitution instance of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>.

If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN> is given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn,y1,...,ym]
</PRE></DIV>
where the variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>y1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ym</SPAN> do not occur free in the
left-hand side, then the result of applying the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th</SPAN> to
a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]</SPAN> will be:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- t[e1,...,en/x1,...,xn] = u[e1,...,en,v1,...,vm/x1,...,xn,y1,...,ym]
</PRE></DIV>
where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vm</SPAN> are variables chosen so as to be free nowhere
in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> or in the input term.  The user has no control over the choice of the
variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vm</SPAN>, and the variables actually chosen may well be
inconvenient for other purposes.  This situation is, however, relatively rare;
in most equations the free variables on the right-hand side are a subset of the
free variables on the left-hand side.

In addition to doing substitution for free variables in the supplied equational
theorem (or `rewrite rule'), <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th tm</SPAN> also does type instantiation,
if this is necessary in order to match the left-hand side of the given rewrite
rule <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> to the term argument <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>.  If, for example, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is the theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn]
</PRE></DIV>
and the input term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> is (a substitution instance of) an instance
of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t[x1,...,xn]</SPAN> in which the types <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ty1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tyi</SPAN> are substituted for the
type variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vty1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vtyi</SPAN>, that is if:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   tm = t[ty1,...,tyn/vty1,...,vtyn][e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]
</PRE></DIV>
then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th tm</SPAN> returns:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   A |- (t = u)[ty1,...,tyn/vty1,...,vtyn][e1,...,en/x1,...,xn]
</PRE></DIV>
Note that, in this case, the type variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vty1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vtyi</SPAN> must
not occur anywhere in the hypotheses <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>.  Otherwise, the conversion will fail.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th</SPAN> fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is not an equation or an equation universally
quantified at the outermost level.  If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is such an equation:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  th = A |- !v1....vi. t[x1,...,xn] = u[x1,...,xn,y1,...,yn]
</PRE></DIV>
then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV th tm</SPAN> fails unless the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> is
alpha-equivalent to an instance of the left-hand side <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t[x1,...,xn]</SPAN> which
can be obtained by instantiation of free type variables (i.e. type variables
not occurring in the assumptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>) and substitution for the free variables
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>xn</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following example illustrates a straightforward use of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN>.
The supplied rewrite rule is polymorphic, and both substitution for free
variables and type instantiation may take place.  <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EQ_SYM_EQ</SPAN> is the theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   |- !x y:A. x = y <=> y = x
</PRE></DIV>
and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV EQ_SYM</SPAN> behaves as follows:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REWR_CONV EQ_SYM_EQ `1 = 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- 1 = 2 <=> 2 = 1
  # REWR_CONV EQ_SYM_EQ `1 < 2`;;
  Exception: Failure "term_pmatch".
</PRE></DIV>
The second application fails because the left-hand side <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`x = y`</SPAN> of
the rewrite rule does not match the term to be rewritten, namely <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`1 < 2`</SPAN>.

In the following example, one might expect the result to be the theorem
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- f 2 = 2</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> is the assumption of the supplied rewrite rule:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REWR_CONV (ASSUME `!x:A. f x = x`) `f 2:num`;;
  Exception: Failure "term_pmatch: can't instantiate local constant".
</PRE></DIV>
The application fails, however, because the type variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> appears
in the assumption of the theorem returned by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME `!x:A. f x = x`</SPAN>.

Failure will also occur in situations like:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REWR_CONV (ASSUME `f (n:num) = n`) `f 2:num`;;
  Exception: Failure "term_pmatch: can't instantiate local constant".
</PRE></DIV>
where the left-hand side of the supplied equation contains a free
variable (in this case <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN>) which is also free in the assumptions, but which
must be instantiated in order to match the input term.
