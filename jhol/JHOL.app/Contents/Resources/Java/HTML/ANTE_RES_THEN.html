<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Resolves implicative assumptions with an antecedent.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem-tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> and a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- t</SPAN>, the function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ANTE_RES_THEN</SPAN> produces a tactic that attempts to match <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> to the antecedent
of each implication
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   Ai |- !x1...xn. ui ==> vi
</PRE></DIV>
(where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai</SPAN> is just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!x1...xn. ui ==> vi</SPAN>) that occurs among the
assumptions of a goal. If the antecedent <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ui</SPAN> of any implication matches <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>,
then an instance of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u A |- vi</SPAN> is obtained by specialization of the
variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>xn</SPAN> and type instantiation, followed by an application of
modus ponens.  Because all implicative assumptions are tried, this may result
in several modus-ponens consequences of the supplied theorem and the
assumptions.  Tactics are produced using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> from all these theorems, and
these tactics are applied in sequence to the goal.  That is,
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   ANTE_RES_THEN ttac (A |- t) g
</PRE></DIV>
has the effect of:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   MAP_EVERY ttac [A1 u A |- v1; ...; Am u A |- vm] g
</PRE></DIV>
where the theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u A |- vi</SPAN> are all the consequences that can
be drawn by a (single) matching modus-ponens inference from the implications
that occur among the assumptions of the goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN> and the supplied theorem
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- t</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ANTE_RES_THEN ttac (A |- t)</SPAN> fails when applied to a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN> if any of the
tactics produced by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac (Ai u A |- vi)</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai u A |- vi</SPAN> is the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th
resolvent obtained from the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- t</SPAN> and the assumptions of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>, fails
when applied in sequence to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>.
