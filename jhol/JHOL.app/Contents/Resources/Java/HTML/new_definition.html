<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>new_definition : term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Declare a new constant and a definitional axiom.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_definition</SPAN> provides a facility for definitional extensions.
It takes a term giving the desired definition.  The value returned by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_definition</SPAN> is a theorem stating the definition requested by the user.

Let <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v_1</SPAN>,...,<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v_n</SPAN> be tuples of distinct variables, containing the variables
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x_1,...,x_m</SPAN>.  Evaluating <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_definition `c v_1 ... v_n = t`</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is a
variable whose name is not already used as a constant, declares <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> to be a new
constant and returns the theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   |- !x_1 ... x_m. c v_1 ... v_n = t
</PRE></DIV>
Optionally, the definitional term argument may have any of its variables
universally quantified.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_definition</SPAN> fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is already a constant or if the definition does
not have the right form.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
A NAND relation on signals indexed by `time' can be defined as follows.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # new_definition
       `NAND2   (in_1,in_2) out <=> !t:num. out t <=> ~(in_1 t /\ in_2 t)`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- !out in_1 in_2.
           NAND2 (in_1,in_2) out <=> (!t. out t <=> ~(in_1 t /\ in_2 t))
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Note that the conclusion of the theorem returned is essentially the same as the
term input by the user, except that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> was a variable in the original term but
is a constant in the returned theorem. The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> is significantly
more flexible in the kinds of definition it allows, but for some purposes this
more basic principle is fine.
