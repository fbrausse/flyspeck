<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Splits a theorem into a list of theorems and then adds them to the assumptions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> and a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(A,t)</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_ASSUME_TAC th</SPAN> splits <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> into
a list of theorems. This is done by recursively breaking conjunctions into
separate conjuncts, cases-splitting disjunctions, and eliminating existential
quantifiers by choosing arbitrary variables.  Schematically, the following
rules are applied:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
           A ?- t
   ======================  STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v1 /\ ... /\ vn)
    A u {v1,...,vn} ?- t

                A ?- t
   =================================  STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v1 \/ ... \/ vn)
    A u {v1} ?- t ... A u {vn} ?- t

          A ?- t
   ====================  STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- ?x.v)
    A u {v[x'/x]} ?- t
</PRE></DIV>
where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x'</SPAN> is a variant of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x</SPAN>.

If the conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is not a conjunction, a disjunction or an
existentially quantified term, the whole theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is added to the
assumptions.

As assumptions are generated, they are examined to see if they solve the goal
(either by being alpha-equivalent to the conclusion of the goal or by deriving
a contradiction).

The assumptions of the theorem being split are not added to the assumptions of
the goal(s), but they are recorded in the proof.  This means that if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A'</SPAN> is
not a subset of the assumptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> of the goal (up to alpha-conversion),
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v)</SPAN> results in an invalid tactic.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
When solving the goal
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `m = 0 + m`;;
</PRE></DIV>
assuming the clauses for addition with
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_ASSUME_TAC ADD_CLAUSES</SPAN> results in the goal
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(STRIP_ASSUME_TAC ADD_CLAUSES);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`!n. 0 + n = n`]
   1 [`!m. m + 0 = m`]
   2 [`!m n. SUC m + n = SUC (m + n)`]
   3 [`!m n. m + SUC n = SUC (m + n)`]

  `m = 0 + m`
</PRE></DIV>
while the same tactic directly solves the goal
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   ?- !m. 0 + m = m
</PRE></DIV>
<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_ASSUME_TAC</SPAN> is used when applying a previously proved theorem to solve a
goal, or when enriching its assumptions so that rewriting with assumptions and
other operations involving assumptions have more to work with.
