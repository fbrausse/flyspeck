<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Equality test on goals.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>equals_goal</SPAN> tests if two goals have exactly the same structure,
with the same assumptions, conclusions and even labels, with the assumptions in
the same order. The only respect in which this differs from a pure equality
tests is that the various term components are tested modulo alpha-conversion.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Probably not generally useful. Used inside <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CHANGED_TAC</SPAN>.
