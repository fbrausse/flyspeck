<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Eliminate all but the current goalstate from the current goalstack.

previous intermediate states further back in the list. This function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>flush_goalstack()</SPAN> keeps just the current goalstate and eliminates all
previous states.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if there is no current goalstate, i.e. if the goalstack is empty.
