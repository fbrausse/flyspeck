<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a term with only the given list of rewrites.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This conversion provides a method for rewriting a term with the theorems given,
and excluding simplification with tautologies in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN>. Matching
subterms are found recursively, until no more matches are found.
For more details on rewriting see
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN> is useful when the simplifications that arise by
rewriting a theorem with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN> are not wanted.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Does not fail. May result in divergence, in which case
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN> can be used.
