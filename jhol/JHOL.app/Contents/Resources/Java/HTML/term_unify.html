<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Unify two terms.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given two terms <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm2</SPAN>, a call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_unify vars tm1 tm2</SPAN> attempts to
find instantiations of the variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vars</SPAN> in the two terms to make them
alpha-equivalent. At present, no type instantiation is done. The unification is
also purely first-order. In these respects it is less general than
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_match</SPAN>, and this may be improved in the future.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the two terms are not first-order unifiable by instantiating the given
variables without type instantiation.
