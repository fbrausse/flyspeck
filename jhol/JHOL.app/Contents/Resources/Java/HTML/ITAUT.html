<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Attempt to prove term using intuitionistic first-order logic.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ITAUT `p`</SPAN> attempts to prove <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> using a basic tableau-type proof
search for intuitionistic first-order logic. The restriction to intuitionistic
logic means that no principles such as the ``law of the excluded middle'' or
``law of double negation'' are used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is non-Boolean. May also fail if it's unprovable, though more
usually this results in indefinite looping.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This is intuitionistically valid, so it works:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ITAUT `~(~(~p)) ==> ~p`;;
  ...
  val it : thm = |- ~ ~ ~p ==> ~p
</PRE></DIV>
whereas this, one of the main non-intuitionistic principles, is not:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ITAUT `~(~p) ==> p`;;
  Searching with limit 0
  Searching with limit 1
  Searching with limit 2
  Searching with limit 3
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
so the procedure loops; you can as usual terminate such loops with
control-C.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Normally, first-order reasoning should be performed by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON[]</SPAN>, which is much
more powerful, complete for all classical logic, and handles equality. The
function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ITAUT</SPAN> is mainly for ``bootstrapping'' purposes. Nevertheless it may
sometimes be intellectually interesting to see that certain logical formulas
are provable intuitionistically.
