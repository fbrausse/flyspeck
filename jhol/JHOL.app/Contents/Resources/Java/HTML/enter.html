<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Enter an object and its pattern term into a term net.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Term nets (type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a net</SPAN>) are a lookup structure
associating objects of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a</SPAN>, e.g. conversions, with a corresponding
`pattern' term. For a given term, one can then relatively quickly look up all
objects whose pattern terms might possibly match to it. This is used, for
example, in rewriting to quickly filter out obviously inapplicable rewrites
rather than attempting each one in turn. The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>enter lconsts (pat,obj) net</SPAN>
enters the item <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>obj</SPAN> into a net <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>obj</SPAN> with indexing pattern term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pat</SPAN>. The
list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lconsts</SPAN> lists variables that should be considered `local constants' when
matching, so will only match terms with exactly the same variable in
corresponding places.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here we construct a net with the conversions for various arithmetic operations
on numerals, each with a pattern term to identify the class of terms to which
it might apply:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  let arithnet = itlist (enter [])
     [`SUC n`,NUM_SUC_CONV;
      `m + n:num`,NUM_ADD_CONV;
      `m - n:num`,NUM_SUB_CONV;
      `m * n:num`,NUM_MULT_CONV;
      `m EXP n`,NUM_EXP_CONV;
      `m DIV n`,NUM_DIV_CONV;
      `m MOD n`,NUM_MOD_CONV]
     empty_net;;
</PRE></DIV>
Now we can define a conversion that uses lookup in this net as a first-stage
filter and tries to apply the results.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  let NUM_ARITH_CONV tm = FIRST_CONV (lookup tm arithnet) tm;;
</PRE></DIV>

Note that this is functionally not really different from just
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
 let NUM_ARITH_CONV' =
   FIRST_CONV [NUM_SUC_CONV; NUM_ADD_CONV; NUM_SUB_CONV; NUM_MULT_CONV;
               NUM_EXP_CONV; NUM_DIV_CONV; NUM_MOD_CONV];;
</PRE></DIV>
but it may be significantly more efficient because instead of
successive attempts to apply the conversions, each one is only invoked when
the term has the right pattern.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let tm = funpow 5 (fun x -> mk_binop `(*):num->num->num` x x) `12`;;
  ...
  time (DEPTH_CONV NUM_ARITH_CONV) term;;
  CPU time (user): 0.12
  ...
  time (DEPTH_CONV NUM_ARITH_CONV') term;;
  CPU time (user): 0.22
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
In situations with very many conversions, each one quite fast, the difference
can be much more striking.
