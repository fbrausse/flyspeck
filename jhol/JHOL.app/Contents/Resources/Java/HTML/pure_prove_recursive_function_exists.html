<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Proves existence of general recursive function but leaves unproven assumptions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pure_prove_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> should be applied
to an existentially quantified term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`?f. def_1[f] /\ ... /\ def_n[f]`</SPAN>, where
each clause <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>def_i</SPAN> is a universally quantified equation with an application of
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> to arguments on the left-hand side. The idea is that these clauses define
the action of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> on arguments of various kinds, for example on an empty list
and nonempty list:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  ?f. (f [] = a) /\ (!h t. CONS h t = k[f,h,t])
</PRE></DIV>
or on even numbers and odd numbers:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  ?f. (!n. f(2 * n) = a[f,n]) /\ (!n. f(2 * n + 1) = b[f,n])
</PRE></DIV>
The returned value is a theorem whose conclusion matches the input term, with
in general one or two assumptions stating what properties must hold so that the
existence of such a function to be deduced. Roughly, one assumption states that
the clauses are not mutually contradictory, as in
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  ?f. (!n. f(n + 1) = 1) /\ (!n. f(n + 2) = 2)
</PRE></DIV>
and the other states that there is some wellfounded order making any
recursion admissible. This rule attempts to eliminate any hypotheses of the
first kind, but does not attempt to guess a wellfounded ordering as
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> does.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails only if the definition is malformed. However it is possible that for an
inadmissible definition the assumptions of the theorem may not hold.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
In the definition of the Fibonacci numbers, the function successfully
eliminates the mutual consistency hypotheses:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # pure_prove_recursive_function_exists
     `?fib. fib 0 = 1 /\ fib 1 = 1 /\
            !n. fib(n + 2) = fib(n) + fib(n + 1)`;;
  val it : thm =
    ?(<<). WF (<<) /\ (!n. T ==> n << n + 2) /\ (!n. T ==> n + 1 << n + 2)
    |- ?fib. fib 0 = 1 /\ fib 1 = 1 /\ (!n. fib (n + 2) = fib n + fib (n + 1))
</PRE></DIV>
but leaves a wellfounded ordering to be given. (By contrast,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> will automatically eliminate it.)

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Normally, use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> for this operation. Use
the present function only when the attempt by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> to discharge the proof obligations is
not successful and merely wastes time.
