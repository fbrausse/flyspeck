<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Stops the quotation parser from recognizing a constant.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>hide_constant "c"</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is the name of a constant, will
prevent the quotation parser from parsing it as such; it will just be parsed as
a variable. The effect can be reversed by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>unhide_constant "c"</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the given name is not a constant of the current theory, or if the
named constant is already hidden.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the constant is
still there in a theory, and may not be redefined.
