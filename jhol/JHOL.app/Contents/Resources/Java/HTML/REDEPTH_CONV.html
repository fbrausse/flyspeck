<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies a conversion bottom-up to all subterms, retraversing changed ones.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV c tm</SPAN> applies the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> repeatedly to all subterms of
the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> and recursively applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV c</SPAN> to each subterm at which
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> succeeds, until there is no subterm remaining for which application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN>
succeeds.

More precisely, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV c tm</SPAN> repeatedly applies the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> to
all the subterms of the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>, including the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> itself. The supplied
conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is applied to the subterms of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> in bottom-up order and is
applied repeatedly (zero or more times, as is done by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REPEATC</SPAN>) to each
subterm until it fails.  If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is successfully applied at least once to a
subterm, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> say, then the term into which <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> is transformed is retraversed by
applying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV c</SPAN> to it.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV c tm</SPAN> never fails but can diverge if the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> can be
applied repeatedly to some subterm of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> without failing.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following example shows how <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV</SPAN> retraverses subterms:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REDEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV `(\f x. (f x) + 1) (\y.y) 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- (\f x. f x + 1) (\y. y) 2 = 2 + 1
</PRE></DIV>
Here, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>BETA_CONV</SPAN> is first applied successfully to the (beta-redex)
subterm:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   `(\f x. (f x) + 1) (\y.y)`
</PRE></DIV>
This application reduces this subterm to:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   `(\x. ((\y.y) x) + 1)`
</PRE></DIV>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REDEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV</SPAN> is then recursively applied to this
transformed subterm, eventually reducing it to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`(\x. x + 1)`</SPAN>. Finally, a
beta-reduction of the top-level term, now the simplified beta-redex
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`(\x. x + 1) 2`</SPAN>, produces <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`2 + 1`</SPAN>.
