<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Sets up a new axiom.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> is a term of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>bool</SPAN>, a call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_axiom tm)</SPAN> creates a
theorem
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   |- tm
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the given term does not have type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>bool</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let ax = new_axiom `x = 1`;;
  val ax : thm = |- x = 1
</PRE></DIV>
Note that as with all theorems, variables are implicitly universally
quantified, so this axiom asserts that all numbers are equal to 1. Of course,
we can then derive a contradiction:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  CONV_RULE NUM_REDUCE_CONV (INST [`0`,`x:num`] ax);;
  val it : thm = |- F
</PRE></DIV>
Normal use of HOL Light should avoid asserting axioms. They can lead to
inconsistency, albeit not in such an obvious way. Provided theories are
extended by definitions, consistency is preserved.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
For most purposes, it is unnecessary to declare new axioms: all of classical
mathematics can be derived by definitional extension alone. Proceeding by
definition is not only more elegant, but also guarantees the consistency of the
deductions made. However, there are certain entities which cannot be modelled
in simple type theory without further axioms, such as higher transfinite
ordinals.
