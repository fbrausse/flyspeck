<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Simple intuitionistic logic prover.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ITAUT</SPAN> attempts to prove the goal using a basic tableau-type proof
search for intuitionistic first-order logic. The restriction to intuitionistic
logic means that no principles such as the ``law of the excluded middle'' or
``law of double negation'' are used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
May fail if the goal is unprovable, e.g. for purely propositional problems. For
unsolvable problems with quantifiers it usually just loops.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we try to prove the logical equivalence of ``contraposition'', already
embedded in the pre-proved theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONTRAPOS_THM</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!p q. (p ==> q) <=> (~q ==> ~p)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
by splitting it into two subgoals:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC THEN EQ_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 2 subgoals (2 total)

  `(~q ==> ~p) ==> p ==> q`

  `(p ==> q) ==> ~q ==> ~p`
</PRE></DIV>
The first subgoal (printed at the bottom) can be solved by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ITAUT_TAC</SPAN>, indicating that it's intuitionistically valid:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e ITAUT_TAC;;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `(~q ==> ~p) ==> p ==> q`
</PRE></DIV>
but the other one isn't, though it is solvable by full classical
logic:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(MESON_TAC[]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Normally, first-order reasoning should be performed by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC[]</SPAN>, which is
much more powerful, complete for all classical logic, and handles equality. The
function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ITAUT_TAC</SPAN> is mainly for ``bootstrapping'' purposes. Nevertheless it
may sometimes be intellectually interesting to see that certain logical
formulas are provable intuitionistically.
