<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>SUBS : thm list -&gt; thm -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Makes simple term substitutions in a theorem using a given list of theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Term substitution in HOL is performed by replacing free subterms according to
the transformations specified by a list of equational theorems.  Given a list
of theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A1|-t1=v1,...,An|-tn=vn</SPAN> and a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A|-t</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBS</SPAN>
simultaneously replaces each free occurrence of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ti</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vi</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
          A1|-t1=v1 ... An|-tn=vn    A|-t
   ---------------------------------------------  SUBS[A1|-t1=v1;...;An|-tn=vn]
    A1 u ... u An u A |- t[v1,...,vn/t1,...,tn]       (A|-t)
</PRE></DIV>
No matching is involved; the occurrence of each <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ti</SPAN> being
substituted for must be a free in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST_MATCH</SPAN>).  An occurrence which
is not free can be substituted by using rewriting rules such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_RULE</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBS [th1;...;thn] (A|-t)</SPAN> fails if the conclusion of each theorem in the list
is not an equation.  No change is made to the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- t</SPAN> if no occurrence
of any left-hand side of the supplied equations appears in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Substitutions are made with the theorems
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
 # let thm1 = SPEC_ALL ADD_SYM
   and thm2 = SPEC_ALL(CONJUNCT1 ADD_CLAUSES);;
  val thm1 : thm = |- m + n = n + m
  val thm2 : thm = |- 0 + n = n
</PRE></DIV>
depending on the occurrence of free subterms
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # SUBS [thm1; thm2] (ASSUME `(n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n`);;
  val it : thm = (n + 0) + 0 + m = m + n |- (n + 0) + 0 + m = n + m

  # SUBS [thm1; thm2] (ASSUME `!n. (n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n`);;
  val it : thm = !n. (n + 0) + 0 + m = m + n |- !n. (n + 0) + 0 + m = m + n
</PRE></DIV>
<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBS</SPAN> can sometimes be used when rewriting (for example, with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_RULE</SPAN>)
would diverge and term instantiation is not needed.  Moreover, applying the
substitution rules is often much faster than using the rewriting rules.
