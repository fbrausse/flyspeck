<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a theorem once including built-in rewrites and the theorem's
assumptions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN> applies all possible rewrites in one step
over the subterms in the conclusion of the theorem, but stops after
rewriting at most once at each subterm. This strategy is specified as
for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN>. For more details see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN>, which
does search recursively (to any depth) for matching subterms. The
general strategy for rewriting theorems is described under
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This tactic is used when rewriting with the hypotheses of a theorem
(as well as a given list of theorems and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN>), when more
than one pass is not required or would result in divergence.
