<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Automated first-order proof search tactic using assumptions of goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_MESON_TAC[theorems]</SPAN> will attempt to establish the goal using
pure first-order reasoning, taking <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>theorems</SPAN> and the assumptions of the goal
as the starting-point. It will usually either solve the goal completely or run
for an infeasible length of time before terminating, but it may sometimes fail
quickly. For more details, see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is unprovable within the search bounds, though not
necessarily in a feasible amount of time.
