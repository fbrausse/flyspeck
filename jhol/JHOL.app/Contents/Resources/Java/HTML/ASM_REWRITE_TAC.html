<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>ASM_REWRITE_TAC : thm list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a goal including built-in rewrites and the goal's assumptions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> generates rewrites with the tautologies in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN>,
the set of assumptions, and a list of theorems supplied by the user. These are
applied top-down and recursively on the goal, until no more matches are found.
The order in which the set of rewrite equations is applied is an implementation
matter and the user should not depend on any ordering. Rewriting strategies are
described in more detail under <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>. For omitting the common
tautologies, see the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> does not fail, but it can diverge in certain
situations. For rewriting to a limited depth, see
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>. The resulting tactic may not be valid if the
applicable replacement introduces new assumptions into the theorem
eventually proved.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The use of assumptions in rewriting, specially when they are not in an
obvious equational form, is illustrated below:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `P ==> (P /\ Q /\ R <=> R /\ Q /\ P)`;;
  Warning: Free variables in goal: P, Q, R
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `P ==> (P /\ Q /\ R <=> R /\ Q /\ P)`

  # e DISCH_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`P`]

  `P /\ Q /\ R <=> R /\ Q /\ P`

  # e(ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`P`]

  `Q /\ R <=> R /\ Q`
