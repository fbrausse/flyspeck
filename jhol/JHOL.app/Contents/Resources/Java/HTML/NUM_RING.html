<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Ring decision procedure instantiated to natural numbers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The rule <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUM_RING</SPAN> should be applied to a formula that, after suitable
normalization, can be considered a universally quantified Boolean combination
of equations and inequations between terms of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:num</SPAN>. If that formula
holds in all integral domains, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUM_RING</SPAN> will prove it. Any ``alien'' atomic
formulas that are not natural number equations will not contribute to the proof
but will not in themselves cause an error. The function is a particular
instantiation of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RING</SPAN>, which is a more generic procedure for ring and
semiring structures.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the formula is unprovable by the methods employed. This does not
necessarily mean that it is not valid for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:num</SPAN>, but rather that it is not
valid on all integral domains (see below).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following formula is proved because it holds in all integral domains:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # NUM_RING `(x + y) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 ==> y = 0 \/ y + 2 * x = 0`;;
  1 basis elements and 0 critical pairs
  Translating certificate to HOL inferences
  val it : thm = |- (x + y) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 ==> y = 0 \/ y + 2 * x = 0
</PRE></DIV>
but the following isn't, even though over <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:num</SPAN> it is equivalent:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # NUM_RING `(x + y) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 ==> y = 0 \/ x = 0`;;
  2 basis elements and 1 critical pairs
  3 basis elements and 2 critical pairs
  3 basis elements and 1 critical pairs
  4 basis elements and 1 critical pairs
  4 basis elements and 0 critical pairs
  Exception: Failure "find".
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Note that since we are working over <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:num</SPAN>, which is not really a ring, cutoff
subtraction is not true ring subtraction and the ability of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUM_RING</SPAN> to
handle it is limited. Instantiations of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RING</SPAN> to actual rings, such as
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RING</SPAN>, have no such problems.
