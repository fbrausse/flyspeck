<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Generic procedure to compute cofactors for ideal membership.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ideal_cofactors</SPAN> function takes first the same set of arguments as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RING</SPAN>,
defining a suitable ring for it to operate over. (See the entry for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RING</SPAN> for
details.) It then yields a function that given a list of terms <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[p1; ...; pn]</SPAN>
and another term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN>, all of which have the right type to be considered as
polynomials over the ring, attempts to find a corresponding set of `cofactors'
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[q1; ...; qn]</SPAN> such that the following is an algebraic ring identity:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  p = p1 * q1 + ... + pn * qn
</PRE></DIV>
That is, it provides a concrete certificate for the fact that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> is in the
ideal generated by the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p1,...,pn</SPAN>. If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> is not in this ideal, the function
will fail.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the `polynomials' are of the wrong type, or if ideal membership does
not hold.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
For an example of the real-number instantiation in action, see
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real_ideal_cofactors</SPAN>.
