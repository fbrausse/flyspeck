<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Interpret a simple varstruct as a variable, even if there is a constant of that
name.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
As well as conventional abstractions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`\x. t`</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x</SPAN> is a variable, HOL
Light permits generalized abstractions where the varstruct is a more complex
term, e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`\(x,y). x + y`</SPAN>. This includes the degenerate case of just a
constant. However, one may want a regular abstraction whose bound variable
happens to be in use as a constant. When parsing a quotation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"\c. t"</SPAN> where
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is the name of a constant, HOL Light interprets it as a simple abstraction
with a variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> when the flag <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ignore_constant_varstruct</SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>, as it
is by default. It will interpret it as a degenerate generalized abstraction,
only useful when applied to the constant <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN>, if the flag is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>false</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
