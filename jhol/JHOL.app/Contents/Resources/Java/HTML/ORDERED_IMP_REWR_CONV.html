<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Basic conditional rewriting conversion restricted by term order.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given an ordering relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ord</SPAN>, an equational theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- !x1...xn. p ==> s
= t</SPAN> that expresses a conditional rewrite rule, the conversion
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ORDERED_IMP_REWR_CONV</SPAN> gives a conversion that applied to any term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s'</SPAN> will
attempt to match the left-hand side of the equation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s = t</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s'</SPAN>, and return
the corresponding theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- p' ==> s' = t'</SPAN>, but only if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ord `s'` `t'`</SPAN>,
i.e. if the left-hand side is ``greater'' in the ordering than the right-hand
side, after instantiation. If the ordering condition is violated, it will fail,
even if the match is fine.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the theorem is not of the right form or the two terms cannot be
matched, for example because the variables that need to be instantiated are
free in the hypotheses <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>, or if the ordering requirement fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Applying conditional rewrite rules that are permutative and would loop without
some ordering restriction. Applied automatically to some permutative rewrite
rules in the simplifier, e.g. in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_CONV</SPAN>.
