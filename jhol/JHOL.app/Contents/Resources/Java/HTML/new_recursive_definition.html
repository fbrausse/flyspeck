<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Define recursive function over inductive type.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_recursive_definition</SPAN> provides the facility for defining primitive
recursive functions on arbitrary inductive types.  The first argument is the
primitive recursion theorem for the concrete type in question; this is normally
the second theorem obtained from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_type</SPAN>. The second argument is a term
giving the desired primitive recursive function definition. The value returned
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_recursive_definition</SPAN> is a theorem stating the primitive recursive
definition requested by the user. This theorem is derived by formal proof from
an instance of the general primitive recursion theorem given as the second
argument.

Let <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>C1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Cn</SPAN> be the constructors of the type, and let `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(Ci vs)</SPAN>'
represent a (curried) application of the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th constructor to a sequence of
variables.  Then a curried primitive recursive function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> over <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ty</SPAN> can be
specified by a conjunction of (optionally universally-quantified) clauses of
the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   fn v1 ... (C1 vs1) ... vm  =  body1   /\
   fn v1 ... (C2 vs2) ... vm  =  body2   /\
                             .
                             .
   fn v1 ... (Cn vsn) ... vm  =  bodyn
</PRE></DIV>
where the variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vm</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vs</SPAN> are distinct in each
clause, and where in the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th clause <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> appears (free) in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>bodyi</SPAN> only
as part of an application of the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   `fn t1 ... v ... tm`
</PRE></DIV>
in which the variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN> of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ty</SPAN> also occurs among the
variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vsi</SPAN>.

If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><definition></SPAN> is a conjunction of clauses, as described above, then
evaluating:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   new_recursive_definition th `<definition>`;;
</PRE></DIV>
automatically proves the existence of a function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> that satisfies
the defining equations, and then declares a new constant with this definition
as its specification.

<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_recursive_definition</SPAN> also allows the supplied definition to omit clauses
for any number of constructors.  If a defining equation for the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th
constructor is omitted, then the value of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> at that constructor:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   fn v1 ... (Ci vsi) ... vn
</PRE></DIV>
is left unspecified (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN>, however, is still a total function).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the definition cannot be matched up with the recursion theorem
provided (you may find that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> still works in such cases), or if there is
already a constant of the given name.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following defines a function to produce the union of a list of sets:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let LIST_UNION = new_recursive_definition list_RECURSION
    `(LIST_UNION [] = {}) /\
     (LIST_UNION (CONS h t) = h UNION (LIST_UNION t))`;;
      Warning: inventing type variables
  val ( LIST_UNION ) : thm =
    |- LIST_UNION [] = {} /\ LIST_UNION (CONS h t) = h UNION LIST_UNION t
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
For many purposes, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define</SPAN> is a simpler way of defining recursive types; it
has a simpler interface (no need to specify the recursion theorem to use) and
it is more general. However, for suitably constrained definitions
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_recursive_definition</SPAN> works well and is much more efficient.
