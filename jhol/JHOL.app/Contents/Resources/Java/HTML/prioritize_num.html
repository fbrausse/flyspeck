<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Give natural number type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN> priority in operator overloading.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Symbols for several arithmetical (`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>', `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>-</SPAN>', ...) and relational (`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT><</SPAN>',
`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>>=</SPAN>', ...) operators are overloaded so that they may denote the operators
for several different number systems, particularly <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN> (natural numbers),
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>int</SPAN> (integers) and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real</SPAN> (real numbers). The choice is normally made based
on some known types, or the presence of operators that are not overloaded for
the number systems. (For example, numerals like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>42</SPAN> are always assumed to be
of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>, while the division operator `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>/</SPAN>' is only defined for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real</SPAN>.)
In the absence of any such indication, a default choice will be made. The
effect of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prioritize_num()</SPAN> is to make <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>, the natural number type, the
default.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
With real priority, most things are interpreted as type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # prioritize_real();;
  val it : unit = ()

  # type_of `x + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:real`
</PRE></DIV>
except that numerals are always of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>, and so:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # type_of `x + 1`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:num`
</PRE></DIV>
By making <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN> the priority, everything is interpreted as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # prioritize_num();;
  val it : unit = ()

  # type_of `x + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:num`
</PRE></DIV>
unless there is some explicit type information to the contrary:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # type_of `(x:real) + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:real`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
It is perhaps better practice to insert types explicitly to avoid dependence on
such defaults, otherwise proofs can become context-dependent. However it is
often very convenient.
