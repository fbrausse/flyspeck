<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>FAIL_TAC : string -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Tactic that always fails, with the supplied string.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Whatever goal it is applied to, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FAIL_TAC "s"</SPAN> always fails with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Failure "s"</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
The application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FAIL_TAC</SPAN> to a string never fails; the resulting
tactic always fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following example uses the fact that if a tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN> solves
a goal, then the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1 THEN t2</SPAN> never results in the application
of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2</SPAN> to anything, because <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN> produces no subgoals. In attempting
to solve the following goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `if x then T else T`;;
</PRE></DIV>
the tactic
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REWRITE_TAC[] THEN FAIL_TAC "Simple rewriting failed to solve goal");;
  Exception: Failure "Simple rewriting failed to solve goal".
</PRE></DIV>
fails with the message provided, whereas the following quietly solves
the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REWRITE_TAC[COND_ID] THEN FAIL_TAC "Using that failed to solve goal");;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>
