<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Generic ring procedure.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RING</SPAN> function takes a number of arguments specifying a ring structure and
giving operations for computing and proving over it. Specifically the call is:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  RING(toterm,tonum,EQ_CONV,
       neg,add,sub,inv,mul,div,pow,
       INTEGRAL_TH,FIELD_TH,POLY_CONV)
</PRE></DIV>
where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>toterm</SPAN> is a conversion from constant terms in the structure
to rational numbers (e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rat_of_term</SPAN> for the reals), <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tonum</SPAN> is the opposite
(e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_of_rat</SPAN> for the reals), <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>EQ_CONV</SPAN> is an equality test conversion
(e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RAT_EQ_CONV</SPAN>), <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>neg</SPAN> is negation, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>add</SPAN> is addition, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>sub</SPAN> is
subtraction, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>inv</SPAN> is multiplicative inverse, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>div</SPAN> is division, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pow</SPAN> is
power, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INTEGRAL_TH</SPAN> is an integrality theorem and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIELD_TH</SPAN> is a field
theorem (see below) and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>POLY_CONV</SPAN> is a polynomial normalization theorem for
the structure as returned by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SEMIRING_NORMALIZERS_CONV</SPAN> (e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_POLY_CONV</SPAN>
for the reals).

The integrality theorem essentially states that if a product is zero, so is one
of the factors (i.e. the structure is an integral domain), but this is stated
in an unnatural way to allow application to structures without negation. It is
permissible in this case to use boolean variables instead of operators such as
negation and subtraction. The precise form of the theorem (notation for natural
numbers, but this is supposed to be over the same structure):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- (!x. 0 * x = 0) /\
     (!x y z. x + y = x + z <=> y = z) /\
     (!w x y z. w * y + x * z = w * z + x * y <=> w = x \/ y = z)
</PRE></DIV>

The field theorem is of the following form. It is not logically necessary, and
if the structure is not a field you can just pass in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TRUTH</SPAN> instead. However,
it is usually beneficial for performance to include it.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- !x y. ~(x = y) <=> ?z. (x - y) * z = 1
</PRE></DIV>

It returns a proof procedure that will attempt to prove a formula that, after
suitable normalization, can be considered a universally quantified Boolean
combination of equations and inequations between terms of the right type. If
that formula holds in all integral domains, it will prove it. Any ``alien''
atomic formulas that are not natural number equations will not contribute to
the proof.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the theorems are malformed.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The instantiation for the real numbers (in fact this is already available under
the name <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RING</SPAN>) could be coded as:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  let REAL_RING =
    let REAL_INTEGRAL = prove
     (`(!x. &amp;0 * x = &amp;0) /\
       (!x y z. (x + y = x + z) <=> (y = z)) /\
       (!w x y z. (w * y + x * z = w * z + x * y) <=> (w = x) \/ (y = z))`,
      REWRITE_TAC[MULT_CLAUSES; EQ_ADD_LCANCEL] THEN
      REWRITE_TAC[GSYM REAL_OF_NUM_EQ;
                  GSYM REAL_OF_NUM_ADD; GSYM REAL_OF_NUM_MUL] THEN
      ONCE_REWRITE_TAC[GSYM REAL_SUB_0] THEN
      REWRITE_TAC[GSYM REAL_ENTIRE] THEN REAL_ARITH_TAC)
    and REAL_INVERSE = prove
     (`!x y:real. ~(x = y) <=> ?z. (x - y) * z = &amp;1`,
      REPEAT GEN_TAC THEN
      GEN_REWRITE_TAC (LAND_CONV o RAND_CONV) [GSYM REAL_SUB_0] THEN
      MESON_TAC[REAL_MUL_RINV; REAL_MUL_LZERO; REAL_ARITH `~(&amp;1 = &amp;0)`]) in
    RING(rat_of_term,term_of_rat,REAL_RAT_EQ_CONV,
         `(--):real->real`,`(+):real->real->real`,`(-):real->real->real`,
         `(inv):real->real`,`(*):real->real->real`,`(/):real->real->real`,
         `(pow):real->num->real`,
         REAL_INTEGRAL,REAL_INVERSE,REAL_POLY_CONV);;
</PRE></DIV>
after which, for example, we can verify a reduction for cubic
equations to quadratics entirely automatically:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_RING
     `p = (&amp;3 * a1 - a2 pow 2) / &amp;3 /\
      q = (&amp;9 * a1 * a2 - &amp;27 * a0 - &amp;2 * a2 pow 3) / &amp;27 /\
      z = x - a2 / &amp;3 /\
      x * w = w pow 2 - p / &amp;3 /\
      ~(p = &amp;0)
      ==> (z pow 3 + a2 * z pow 2 + a1 * z + a0 = &amp;0 <=>
          (w pow 3) pow 2 - q * (w pow 3) - p pow 3 / &amp;27 = &amp;0)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
