<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Solves a goal if supplied with the desired theorem (up to alpha-conversion).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ACCEPT_TAC</SPAN> maps a given theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> to a tactic that solves any goal whose
conclusion is alpha-convertible to the conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ACCEPT_TAC th (A ?- g)</SPAN> fails if the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN> is not alpha-convertible to the
conclusion of the supplied theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>BOOL_CASES_AX = |- !t. (t <=> T) \/ (t <=> F)</SPAN> can be used to
solve the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!x. (x <=> T) \/ (x <=> F)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
by
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(ACCEPT_TAC BOOL_CASES_AX);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Used for completing proofs by supplying an existing theorem, such as an axiom,
or a lemma already proved. Often this can simply be done by rewriting, but
there are times when greater delicacy is wanted.
