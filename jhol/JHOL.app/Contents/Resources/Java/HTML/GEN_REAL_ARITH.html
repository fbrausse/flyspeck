<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Initial normalization and proof reconstruction wrapper for real decision
procedure.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REAL_ARITH</SPAN> takes two arguments, the first of which is an
underlying `prover', and the second a term to prove. This function is mainly
intended for internal use: the function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ARITH</SPAN> is essentially implemented
as
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  GEN_REAL_ARITH REAL_LINEAR_PROVER
</PRE></DIV>
The wrapper <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REAL_ARITH</SPAN> performs various initial normalizations, such as
eliminating <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>max</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>min</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>abs</SPAN>, and passes to the prover a proof
reconstruction function, say <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>reconstr</SPAN>, and a triple of theorem lists to
refute. The theorem lists are respectively a list of equations of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A_i
|- p_i = &amp;0</SPAN>, a list of non-strict inequalities of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>B_j |- q_i >= &amp;0</SPAN>,
and a list of strict inequalities of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>C_k |- r_k > &amp;0</SPAN>, with both
sides being real in each case. The underlying prover merely needs to find a
``Positivstellensatz'' refutation, and pass the triple of theorems actually
used and the Positivstellensatz refutation back to the reconstruction function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>reconstr</SPAN>. A Positivstellensatz refutation is essentially a representation of
how to add and multiply equalities or inequalities chosen from the list to
reach a trivially false equation or inequality such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>&amp;0 > &amp;0</SPAN>. Note that the
underlying prover may choose to augment the list of inequalities before
proceeding with the proof, e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_LINEAR_PROVER</SPAN> adds theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- &amp;0 <=
&amp;n</SPAN> for relevant numeral terms <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>&amp;n</SPAN>. This is why the interface passes in a
reconstruction function rather than simply expecting a Positivstellensatz
refutation back.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails at this stage, though it may fail when subsequently applied to a
term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
As noted, the built-in decision procedure <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ARITH</SPAN> is a simple application.
See also the file <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Examples/sos.ml</SPAN>, where a more sophisticated nonlinear
prover is plugged into <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REAL_ARITH</SPAN> in place of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_LINEAR_PROVER</SPAN>.
