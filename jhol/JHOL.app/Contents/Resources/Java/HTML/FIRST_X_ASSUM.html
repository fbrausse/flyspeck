<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>FIRST_X_ASSUM : thm_tactic -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies theorem-tactic to first assumption possible, extracting assumption.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   FIRST_X_ASSUM ttac ([A1; ...; An], g)
</PRE></DIV>
has the effect of applying the first tactic which can be produced by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> from the assumptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(.. |- A1)</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(.. |- An)</SPAN> and which
succeeds when applied to the goal with that assumption removed. Failures of
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to produce a tactic are ignored. The similar function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIRST_ASSUM</SPAN> is
the same except that the assumption used is not removed from the goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac (.. |- Ai)</SPAN> fails for every assumption <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Ai</SPAN>, or if the
assumption list is empty, or if all the tactics produced by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> fail when
applied to the goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The tactic
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   FIRST_X_ASSUM MATCH_MP_TAC
</PRE></DIV>
searches the assumption list for an implication whose conclusion
matches the goal, removing that assumption and reducing the goal to the
antecedent of the corresponding instance of this implication.
