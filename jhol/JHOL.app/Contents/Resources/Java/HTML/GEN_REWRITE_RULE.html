<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a theorem, selecting terms according to a user-specified strategy.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Rewriting in HOL is based on the use of equational theorems as left-to-right
replacements on the subterms of an object theorem.  This replacement is
mediated by the use of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN>, which finds matches between left-hand sides
of given equations in a term and applies the substitution.

Equations used in rewriting are obtained from the theorem lists given as
arguments to the function. These are at first transformed into a form suitable
for rewriting. Conjunctions are separated into individual rewrites. Theorems
with conclusions of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`~t`</SPAN> are transformed into the corresponding
equations <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`t = F`</SPAN>. Theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`t`</SPAN> which are not equations are cast as
equations of form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`t = T`</SPAN>.

If a theorem is used to rewrite the object theorem, its assumptions are added
to the assumptions of the returned theorem, unless they are alpha-convertible
to existing assumptions.  The matching involved uses variable instantiation.
Thus, all free variables are generalized, and terms are instantiated before
substitution. Theorems may have universally quantified variables.

The theorems with which rewriting is done are divided into two groups, to
facilitate implementing other rewriting tools. However, they are considered in
an order-independent fashion. (That is, the ordering is an implementation
detail which is not specified.)

The search strategy for finding matching subterms is the first argument to the
rule. Matching and substitution may occur at any level of the term, according
to the specified search strategy: the whole term, or starting from any subterm.
The search strategy also specifies the depth of the search: recursively up to
an arbitrary depth until no matches occur, once over the selected subterm, or
any more complex scheme.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN> fails if the search strategy fails. It may also cause a
non-terminating sequence of rewrites, depending on the search strategy used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This rule is used in the system to implement all other rewriting
rules, and may provide a user with a method to fine-tune rewriting of
theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we have a theorem of the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   mythm = |- (1 + 2) + 3 = (3 + 1) + 2
</PRE></DIV>
and we would like to rewrite the left-hand side with the
theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ADD_SYM</SPAN> without changing the right hand side. This can be
done by using:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   GEN_REWRITE_RULE (RATOR_CONV o ONCE_DEPTH_CONV) []  [ADD_SYM] mythm
</PRE></DIV>
Other rules, such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_RULE</SPAN>, would match and
substitute on both sides, which would not be the desirable result.
