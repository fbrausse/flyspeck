<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>list_mk_icomb : string -&gt; term list -&gt; term</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies constant to list of arguments, instantiating constant type as needed.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>list_mk_icomb "c" [a1; ...; an]</SPAN> will make the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c a1 ... an</SPAN>
where c is a constant, after first instantiating <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN>'s generic type so that the
types are compatible.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> is not a constant or if the types cannot be instantiated to match
up with the argument list.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
This would fail with the basic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>list_mk_comb</SPAN> function
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # list_mk_icomb "=" [`1`; `2`];;
  val it : term = `1 = 2`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Note that in general the generic type of the constant is only instantiated
sufficiently to make its type match the arguments, which does not necessarily
determine it completely. Unless you are sure this will be sufficient, it is
safer and probably more efficient to instantiate the type manually using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>inst</SPAN>
first.
