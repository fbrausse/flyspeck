<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>CONJ_ACI_RULE : term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Proves equivalence of two conjunctions containing same set of conjuncts.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONJ_ACI_RULE `t1 /\ ... /\ tn <=> u1 /\ ... /\ um`</SPAN>, where both
sides of the equation are conjunctions of exactly the same set of conjuncts,
(with arbitrary ordering, association, and repetitions), will return the
corresponding theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- t1 /\ ... /\ tn <=> u1 /\ ... /\ um</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if applied to a term that is not a Boolean equation or the two sets of
conjuncts are different.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # CONJ_ACI_RULE `(a /\ b) /\ (a /\ c) <=> (a /\ (c /\ a)) /\ b`;;
  val it : thm = |- (a /\ b) /\ a /\ c <=> (a /\ c /\ a) /\ b
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
The same effect can be had with the more general <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>AC</SPAN> construct. However, for
the special case of conjunction, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONJ_ACI_RULE</SPAN> is substantially more
efficient when there are many conjuncts involved.
