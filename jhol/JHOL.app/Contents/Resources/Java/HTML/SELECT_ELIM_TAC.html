<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Eliminate select terms from a goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SELECT_ELIM_TAC</SPAN> attempts to remove from a goal any select terms,
i.e. instances of the Hilbert choice operator <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>@x. P[x]</SPAN>. First, any instances
that occur inside their own predicate, i.e. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>P[@x. P[x]]</SPAN>, are replaced simply
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>?x. P[x]</SPAN>, as with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SELECT_CONV</SPAN>. Other select-terms are eliminated by
replacing each on with a new variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN> and adding a corresponding instance
of the axiom <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SELECT_AX</SPAN>, of the form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>!x. P[x] ==> P[v]</SPAN>. Note that the latter
does not strictly preserve logical equivalence, only implication. So it is
possible to replace a provable goal by an unprovable one. But since not much is
provable about a select term except via the axiom <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SELECT_AX</SPAN>, this is not
likely in practice.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we set the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `(@n. n < 3) < 3 /\ (@n. n < 3) < 5`;;
</PRE></DIV>
An application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SELECT_ELIM_TAC</SPAN> returns:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e SELECT_ELIM_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `!_73133. (!x. x < 3 ==> _73133 < 3) ==> (?n. n < 3) /\ _73133 < 5`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This is already applied as an initial normalization by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> and other rules.
Users may occasionally find it helpful.
