<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Convert a term to negation normal form.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NNF_CONV</SPAN> proves a term equal to an equivalent in `negation
normal form' (NNF). This means that other propositional connectives are
eliminated in favour of conjunction (`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>/\</SPAN>'), disjunction (`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>\/</SPAN>') and negation
(`<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>~</SPAN>'), and the negations are pushed down to the level of atomic formulas,
also through universal and existential quantifiers, with double negations
eliminated.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails; on non-Boolean terms it just returns a reflexive theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # NNF_CONV `(!x. p(x) <=> q(x)) ==> ~ ?y. p(y) /\ ~q(y)`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : thm =
    |- (!x. p x <=> q x) ==> ~(?y. p y /\ ~q y) <=>
       (?x. p x /\ ~q x \/ ~p x /\ q x) \/ (!y. ~p y \/ q y)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Mostly useful as a prelude to automated proof procedures, but users may
sometimes find it useful.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
A toplevel equivalence <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p <=> q</SPAN> is converted to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(p /\ q) \/ (~p /\ ~q)</SPAN>. In
general this ``splitting'' of equivalences is done with the expectation that
the final formula may be put into disjunctive normal form (DNF), as a prelude
to a refutation procedure. An otherwise similar conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NNFC_CONV</SPAN> prefers
a `conjunctive' splitting and is better suited for a term that will later be
translated to CNF.
