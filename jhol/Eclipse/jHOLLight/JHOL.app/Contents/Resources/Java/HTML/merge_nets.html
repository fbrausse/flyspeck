<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Merge together two term nets.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Term nets (type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a net</SPAN>) are a lookup structure associating objects of type
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a</SPAN>, e.g. conversions, with a corresponding `pattern' term. For a given term,
one can then relatively quickly look up all objects whose pattern terms might
possibly match to it. This is used, for example, in rewriting to quickly filter
out obviously inapplicable rewrites rather than attempting each one in turn.
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>merge_nets(net1,net2)</SPAN> merges two nets together; the list of objects
is the union of those objects in the two nets <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net2</SPAN>, with the term
patterns adjusted appropriately.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
If we have one term net containing the addition conversion:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let net1 = enter [] (`x + y`,NUM_ADD_CONV) empty_net;;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
and another with beta-conversion:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let net2 = enter [] (`(\x. t) y`,BETA_CONV) empty_net;;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
we can combine them into a single net:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let net = merge_nets(net1,net2);;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
