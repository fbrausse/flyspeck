<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Automatically prove elementary divisibility property over the natural numbers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUMBER_RULE</SPAN> is a partly heuristic rule that can often automatically prove
elementary ``divisibility'' properties of the natural numbers. The precise
subset that is dealt with is difficult to describe rigorously, but many
universally quantified combinations of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>divides</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>coprime</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>gcd</SPAN> and
congruences <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(x == y) (mod n)</SPAN> can be proved automatically, as well as some
existentially quantified goals. See a similar rule <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INTEGER_RULE</SPAN> for the
integers for a representative set of examples.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is not accessible to the methods used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is a typical example, which would be rather tedious to prove manually:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # NUMBER_RULE
     `!a b a' b'. ~(gcd(a,b) = 0) /\ a = a' * gcd(a,b) /\ b = b' * gcd(a,b)
                  ==> coprime(a',b')`;;
  ...
  val it : thm =
  |- !a b a' b'.
        ~(gcd (a,b) = 0) /\ a = a' * gcd (a,b) /\ b = b' * gcd (a,b)
        ==> coprime (a',b')
</PRE></DIV>
