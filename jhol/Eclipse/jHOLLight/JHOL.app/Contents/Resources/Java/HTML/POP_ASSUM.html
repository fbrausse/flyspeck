<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>POP_ASSUM : thm_tactic -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies tactic generated from the first element of a goal's assumption list.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a theorem-tactic and a goal, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>POP_ASSUM</SPAN> applies
the theorem-tactic to the first element of the assumption list,
and applies the resulting tactic to the goal without the first
assumption in its assumption list:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
    POP_ASSUM f ({A1;...;An} ?- t) = f (... |- A1) ({A2;...;An} ?- t)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the assumption list of the goal is empty, or the theorem-tactic
fails when applied to the popped assumption, or if the resulting tactic
fails when applied to the goal (with depleted assumption list).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
It is possible simply to use the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME `A1`</SPAN> as required rather than
use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>POP_ASSUM</SPAN>; this will also maintain <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A1</SPAN> in the assumption list,
which is generally useful. In addition, this approach can equally well be
applied to assumptions other than the first.

There are admittedly times when <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>POP_ASSUM</SPAN> is convenient, but it is unwise to
use it if there is more than one assumption in the assumption list, since this
introduces a dependency on the ordering and makes proofs somewhat brittle with
respect to changes.

Another point to consider is that if the relevant assumption has been obtained
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISCH_TAC</SPAN>, it is often cleaner to use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISCH_THEN</SPAN> with a theorem-tactic.
For example, instead of:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   DISCH_TAC THEN POP_ASSUM (fun th -> SUBST1_TAC (SYM th))
</PRE></DIV>
one might use
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   DISCH_THEN (SUBST1_TAC o SYM)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Starting with the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!f x. 0 = x ==> f(x * f(x)) = f(x)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
and breaking it down:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT STRIP_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`0 = x`]

  `f (x * f x) = f x`
</PRE></DIV>
we might use the equation to substitute backwards:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(POP_ASSUM(SUBST1_TAC o SYM) THEN REWRITE_TAC[MULT_CLAUSES]);;
</PRE></DIV>
but another alternative would have been:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REWRITE_TAC[MULT_CLAUSES; SYM(ASSUME `0 = x`)]);;
</PRE></DIV>
and we could even have avoided putting the equation in the
assumptions at all by from the beginning doing:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC THEN DISCH_THEN(SUBST1_TAC o SYM) THEN
      REWRITE_TAC[MULT_CLAUSES]);;
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Making more delicate use of an assumption than rewriting or resolution
using it.
