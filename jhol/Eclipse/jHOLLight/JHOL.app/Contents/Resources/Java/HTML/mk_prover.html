<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Construct a prover from applicator and state augmentation function.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The HOL Light simplifier (e.g. as invoked by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN>) allows provers of type
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prover</SPAN> to be installed into simpsets, to automatically dispose of
side-conditions. These may maintain a state dynamically and augment it as more
theorems become available (e.g. a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p |- p</SPAN> becomes available when
simplifying the consequent of an implication <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`p ==> q`</SPAN>). In order to allow
maximal flexibility in the data structure used to maintain state, provers are
set up in an `object-oriented' style, where the context is part of the prover
function itself. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_prover app aug</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>app: 'a -> conv</SPAN> is an
application operation to prove a term using the context of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>aug :
'a -> thm list -> 'a</SPAN> is an augmentation operation to add whatever
representation of the theorem list in the state of the prover is chosen, gives
a canonical prover of this form. The crucial point is that the type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a</SPAN> is
invisible in the resulting prover, so different provers can maintain their
state in different ways. (In the trivial case, one might just use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thm list</SPAN>
for the state, and appending for the augmentation.)

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Does not normally fail unless the functions provided are abnormal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This is mostly for experts wishing to customize the simplifier.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
I learned of this ingenious trick for maintaining context from Don Syme, who
discovered it by reading some code written by Richard Boulton. I was told by
Simon Finn that there are similar ideas in the functional language literature
for simulating existential types.
