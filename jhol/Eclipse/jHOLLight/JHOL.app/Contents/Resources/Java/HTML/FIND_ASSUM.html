<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>FIND_ASSUM : thm_tactic -&gt; term -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Apply a theorem-tactic to the the first assumption equal to given term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIND_ASSUM ttac `t`</SPAN> finds the first assumption whose conclusion is
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, and applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to it. If there is no such assumption, the call fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if there is no assumption the same as the given term, or if the
theorem-tactic itself fails on the assumption.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we set up this goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `0 = x /\ y = 0 ==> f(x + f(y)) = f(f(f(x) * x * y))`;;
</PRE></DIV>
and move the hypotheses into the assumption list:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e STRIP_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`0 = x`]
   1 [`y = 0`]

  `f (x + f y) = f (f (f x * x * y))`
</PRE></DIV>
We can't just use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]</SPAN> to solve the goal, but we can more
directly use the assumptions:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(FIND_ASSUM SUBST1_TAC `y = 0` THEN
      FIND_ASSUM (SUBST1_TAC o SYM) `0 = x`);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`0 = x`]
   1 [`y = 0`]

  `f (0 + f 0) = f (f (f 0 * 0 * 0))`
</PRE></DIV>
after which simple rewriting solves the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REWRITE_TAC[ADD_CLAUSES; MULT_CLAUSES]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Identifying an assumption to use by explicitly quoting it.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
A similar effect can be achieved by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac(ASSUME `t`)</SPAN>. The use of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>FIND_ASSUM</SPAN>
may be considered preferable because it immediately fails if there is no
assumption <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, whereas the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME</SPAN> construct only generates a validity
failure. Still, the the above example, it would have been a little briefer to
write:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REWRITE_TAC[ASSUME `y = 0`; SYM(ASSUME `0 = x`);
                  ADD_CLAUSES; MULT_CLAUSES]);;
</PRE></DIV>
