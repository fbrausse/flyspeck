<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC : thm list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a goal once including built-in rewrites and the goal's assumptions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> behaves in the same way as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>,
but makes one pass only through the term of the goal. The order in
which the given theorems are applied is an implementation matter and
the user should not depend on any ordering. See <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> for
more information on rewriting a goal in HOL.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> does not fail and, unlike <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>,
does not diverge. The resulting tactic may not be valid, if the
rewrites performed add new assumptions to the theorem eventually
proved.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The use of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> to control the amount of rewriting
performed is illustrated on this goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `a = b /\ b = c ==> (P a b <=> P c a)`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  Warning: Free variables in goal: P, a, b, c
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `a = b /\ b = c ==> (P a b <=> P c a)`

  # e STRIP_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`a = b`]
   1 [`b = c`]

  `P a b <=> P c a`
</PRE></DIV>
The application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> rewrites each applicable subterm just
once:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`a = b`]
   1 [`b = c`]

  `P b c <=> P c b`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> can be applied once or iterated as required to
give the effect of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, either to avoid divergence or to
save inference steps.
