<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Lift a function on representing type to quotient type of equivalence classes.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Suppose type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>qty</SPAN> is a quotient type of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty</SPAN> under an equivalence relation
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R:rty->rty->bool</SPAN>, as defined by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type</SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> is a function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f:ty1->...->tyn->ty</SPAN>, some <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tyi</SPAN> being the representing type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty</SPAN>. The term
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_function</SPAN> should be applied to (i) a theorem of the form
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- (?x. r = R x) <=> rep(abs r) = r</SPAN> as returned by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type</SPAN>,
(ii) a pair of
theorems asserting that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN> is reflexive and transitive, (iii) a desired name
for the counterpart of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> lifted to the type of equivalence classes, and (iv)
a theorem asserting that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> is ``welldefined'', i.e. respects the equivalence
class. This last theorem essentially asserts that the value of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> is
independent of the choice of representative: any <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN>-equivalent inputs give an
equal output, or an <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN>-equivalent one. Syntactically, the welldefinedness
theorem should be of the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- !x1 x1' .. xn xn'. (x1 == x1') /\ ... /\ (xn == xn')
                        ==> (f x1 .. xn == f x1' .. f nx')
</PRE></DIV>
where each <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>==</SPAN> may be either equality or the relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>R</SPAN>, the
latter of course only if the type of that argument is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rty</SPAN>. The reflexivity
and transitivity theorems should be
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- !x. R x x
</PRE></DIV>
and
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- !x y z. R x y /\ R y z ==> R x z
</PRE></DIV>
It returns two theorems, a definition and a consequential theorem that can be
used by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_theorem</SPAN> later.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the theorems are malformed or if there is already a constant of the
given name.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose that we have defined a type of finite multisets as in the documentation
for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_quotient_type</SPAN>, based on the equivalence relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>multisame</SPAN> on
lists. First we prove that the equivalence relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>multisame</SPAN> is indeed
reflexive and transitive:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let MULTISAME_REFL,MULTISAME_TRANS = (CONJ_PAIR o prove)
     (`(!l:(A)list. multisame l l) /\
       (!l1 l2 l3:(A)list.
            multisame l1 l2 /\ multisame l2 l3 ==> multisame l1 l3)`,
      REWRITE_TAC[multisame] THEN MESON_TAC[]);;
</PRE></DIV>
We would like to define the multiplicity of an element in a multiset. First we
define this notion on the representing type of lists:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let listmult = new_definition
     `listmult a l = LENGTH (FILTER (\x:A. x = a) l)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
and prove that it is welldefined. Note that the second argument is
the only one we want to lift to the quotient type, so that's the only one for
which we use the relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>multisame</SPAN>. For the first argument and the result we
only use equality:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let LISTMULT_WELLDEF = prove
     (`!a a':A l l'.
        a = a' /\ multisame l l' ==> listmult a l = listmult a' l'`,
      SIMP_TAC[listmult; multisame]);;
</PRE></DIV>
Now we can lift it to a multiplicity function on the quotient type:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let multiplicity,multiplicity_th =
      lift_function multiset_rep (MULTISAME_REFL,MULTISAME_TRANS)
      "multiplicity" LISTMULT_WELLDEF;;
  val multiplicity : thm =
    |- multiplicity a l = (@u. ?l. listmult a l = u /\ list_of_multiset l l)
  val multiplicity_th : thm =
    |- listmult a l = multiplicity a (multiset_of_list (multisame l))
</PRE></DIV>
Another example is the `union' of multisets, which we can consider as the
lifting of the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>APPEND</SPAN> operation on lists, which we show is welldefined:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let APPEND_WELLDEF = prove
     (`!l l' m m' :A list.
         multisame l l' /\ multisame m m'
         ==> multisame (APPEND l m) (APPEND l' m')`,
      SIMP_TAC[multisame; FILTER_APPEND]);;
</PRE></DIV>
and lift as follows:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let munion,munion_th =
      lift_function multiset_rep (MULTISAME_REFL,MULTISAME_TRANS)
      "munion" APPEND_WELLDEF;;
  val munion : thm =
    |- munion l m =
       multiset_of_list
       (\u. ?l m.
                multisame (APPEND l m) u /\
                list_of_multiset l l /\
                list_of_multiset m m)
  val munion_th : thm =
    |- multiset_of_list (multisame (APPEND l m)) =
       munion (multiset_of_list (multisame l)) (multiset_of_list (multisame m))
</PRE></DIV>
For continuation of this example, showing how to lift theorems from the
representing functions to the functions on the quotient type, see the
documentation entry for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lift_theorem</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
If, as in these examples, the representing type is parametrized by type
variables, make sure that the same type variables are used consistently in the
various theorems.
