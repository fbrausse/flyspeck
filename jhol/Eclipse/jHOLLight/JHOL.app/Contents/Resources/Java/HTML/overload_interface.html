<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Overload a symbol so it may denote a particular underlying constant.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
HOL Light allows the same identifier to denote several different underlying
constants. A call to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>overload_interface("ident",`cname`)</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>cname</SPAN> is
either a constant to be denoted or a variable with the same name and type (if
the constant is not yet defined) will include <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>cname</SPAN> as one of the possible
overload resolutions of the symbol <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ident</SPAN>. Moreover, when the resolution is
not possible from type information, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>cname</SPAN> will now be the default. However,
before any calls to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>overload_interface</SPAN>, the constant must have been declared
overloadable with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>make_overloadable</SPAN>, and the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`cname`</SPAN> must have a type
that is an instance of the most general ``type skeleton'' specified there.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the identifier has not been declared overloadable, if the term is not
a constant or variable, or it its type is not an instance of the declared type
skeleton.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The symbol `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>' has an overload skeleton of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`:A->A->A`</SPAN>. Here we
overload it on type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:bool</SPAN> to denote logical `or'. (This is just for
illustration; it's strongly recommended that you don't do this, since you will
typically need to add more type annotations in terms to compensate for the
ambiguity.)
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # overload_interface("+",`(\/)`);;
  val it : unit = ()
</PRE></DIV>
Now we can use the symbol `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>' with multiple meanings in the same
terms; the underlying constants are still the original ones, though:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # `(x = 1) + (1 + 1 = 2)`;;
  val it : term = `(x = 1) + (1 + 1 = 2)`
</PRE></DIV>
You can also overload polymorphic symbols, e.g. overload `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>' so that it maps
to list append:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # overload_interface("+",`APPEND`);;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : unit = ()

  # APPEND;;
  val it : thm = |- (!l. [] + l = l) /\ (!h t l. CONS h t + l = CONS h (t + l))
</PRE></DIV>
