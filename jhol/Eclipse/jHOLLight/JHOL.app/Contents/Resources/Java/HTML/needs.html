<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Load a file if not already loaded.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The given file is loaded from the path as for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loadt</SPAN>, unless it has already
been loaded into the current session (by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loads</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loadt</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>needs</SPAN>) and has
apparently (based on an MD5 checksum) not changed since then.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the file is not found or generates a failure on loading.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
If a proof relies on more number theory, you might start it with
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  needs "Library/prime.ml";;
  needs "Library/pocklington.ml";;
</PRE></DIV>
If necessary, these files will be loaded as for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>loadt</SPAN>. However, if they have
already been loaded (e.g. if the current proof is a component of a larger proof
that has already used them), they will not be reloaded.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
The <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>needs</SPAN> function gives a simple form of dependency management. It is good
practice to start every file with a <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>needs</SPAN> declaration for any library that it
depends on.
