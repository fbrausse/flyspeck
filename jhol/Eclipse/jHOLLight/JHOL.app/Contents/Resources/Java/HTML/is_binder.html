<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>is_binder : string -&gt; term -&gt; bool</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Tests if a term is a binder construct with named constant.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>is_binder "c" t</SPAN> tests whether the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> has the form of an
application of a constant <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> to an abstraction. Note that this has nothing to
do with the parsing status of the name <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> as a binder, but only the form of
the term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # is_binder "!" `!x. x >= 0`;;
  val it : bool = true
</PRE></DIV>
Note how only the basic logical form is tested, even taking in things
that we wouldn't really think of as binders:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # is_binder "=" `(=) (\x. x + 1)`;;
  val it : bool = true
</PRE></DIV>
