<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
The underlying machinery in rewriting and simplification assembles
(conditional) rewrite rules and other conversions into a net, including a
priority number so that, for example, pure rewrites get applied before
conditional rewrites. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net_of_conv `pat` cnv net</SPAN> will add <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>cnv</SPAN> to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net</SPAN> with priority 2 (lower than pure rewrites but higher than conditional
ones) to give a new net; this net can be used by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITES_CONV</SPAN>, for example.
The term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pat</SPAN> is a pattern used inside the net to place <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>conv</SPAN> appropriately
(see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>enter</SPAN> for more details). This means that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>cnv</SPAN> will never even be tried
on terms that clearly cannot be instances of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>pat</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.
