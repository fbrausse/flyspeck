<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Sorts a list using a given transitive `ordering' relation.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   sort op list
</PRE></DIV>
where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>op</SPAN> is a transitive relation on the elements of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>list</SPAN>, will
topologically sort the list, i.e. will permute it such that if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x op y</SPAN> but not
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>y op x</SPAN> then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x</SPAN> will occur to the left of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>y</SPAN> in the sorted list. In
particular if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>op</SPAN> is a total order, the list will be sorted in the usual sense
of the word.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
A simple example is:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # sort (<) [3; 1; 4; 1; 5; 9; 2; 6; 5; 3; 5; 8; 9; 7; 9];;
  val it : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3; 3; 4; 5; 5; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 9; 9]
</PRE></DIV>
The following example is a little more complicated, and shows how a
topological sorting under the relation `is free in' can be achieved. This is
actually sometimes useful to consider subterms of a term in an appropriate
order:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # sort free_in [`(x + 1) + 2`; `x + 2`; `x:num`; `x + 1`; `1`];;
  val it : term list = [`1`; `x`; `x + 1`; `x + 2`; `(x + 1) + 2`]
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This function uses the Quicksort algorithm internally, which has good
typical-case performance and will sort topologically. However, its worst-case
performance is quadratic. By contrast <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mergesort</SPAN> gives a good worst-case
performance but requires a total order. Note that any comparison-based
topological sorting function must have quadratic behaviour in the worst case.
For an $n$-element list, there are $n (n - 1) / 2$ pairs. For any topological
sorting algorithm, we can make sure the first $n (n - 1) / 2 - 1$ pairs
compared are unrelated in either direction, while still leaving the option of
choosing for the last pair $(a,b)$ either $a < b$ or $b < a$, eventually giving
a partial order. So at least $n (n - 1) / 2$ comparisons are needed to
distinguish these two partial orders correctly.
