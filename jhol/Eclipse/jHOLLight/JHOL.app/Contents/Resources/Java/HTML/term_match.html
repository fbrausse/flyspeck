<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>term_match : term list -&gt; term -&gt; term -&gt; instantiation</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Match one term against another.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_match lcs t t'</SPAN> attempts to find an instantiation for free
variables in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, not permitting assignment of `local constant' variables in
the list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lcs</SPAN>, so that it is alpha-equivalent to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t'</SPAN>. If it succeeds, the
appropriate instantiation is returned. Otherwise it fails. The matching is
higher-order in a limited sense; see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PART_MATCH</SPAN> for more illustrations.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if terms cannot be matched.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # term_match [] `x + y + 1` `(y + 1) + z + 1`;;
  val it : instantiation = ([], [(`z`, `y`); (`y + 1`, `x`)], [])

  # term_match [] `~(?x:A. P x)` `~(?n. 5 < n /\ n < 6)`;;
  val it : instantiation =
    ([(1, `P`)], [(`\n. 5 < n /\ n < 6`, `P`)], [(`:num`, `:A`)])
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This function can occasionally `succeed' yet produce a match that does not in
fact work. In typical uses, this will be implicitly checked by a subsequent
inference process. However, to get a self-contained matching effect, the user
should check that the instantiation returned does achieve a match, e.g. by
applying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>instantiate</SPAN>.
