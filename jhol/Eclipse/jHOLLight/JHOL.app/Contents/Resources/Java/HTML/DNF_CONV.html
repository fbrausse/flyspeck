<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>DNF_CONV : conv</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Converts a term already in negation normal form into disjunctive normal form.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a term already in negation normal form (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NNF_CONV</SPAN>),
meaning that all other propositional connectives have been eliminated in favour
of disjunction, disjunction and negation, and negation is only applied to
atomic formulas, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DNF_CONV</SPAN> puts the term into an equivalent disjunctive normal
form, which is a right-associated disjunction of conjunctions without
repetitions. No reduction by subsumption is performed, however, e.g. from
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a \/ a /\ b</SPAN> to just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails; non-Boolean terms will just yield a reflexive theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # DNF_CONV `(a \/ b) /\ (a \/ c /\ e)`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (a \/ b) /\ (a \/ c /\ e) <=> a \/ a /\ b \/ a /\ c /\ e \/ b /\ c /\ e
