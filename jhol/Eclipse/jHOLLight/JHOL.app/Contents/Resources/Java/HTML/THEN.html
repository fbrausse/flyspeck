<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>(THEN) : tactic -&gt; tactic -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies two tactics in sequence.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2</SPAN> are tactics, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1 THEN t2</SPAN> is a tactic which applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN> to a
goal, then applies the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2</SPAN> to all the subgoals generated. If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN>
solves the goal then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2</SPAN> is never applied.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
The application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>THEN</SPAN> to a pair of tactics never fails.
The resulting tactic fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN> fails when applied to the goal, or if
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2</SPAN> does when applied to any of the resulting subgoals.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we want to prove the inbuilt theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DELETE_INSERT</SPAN> ourselves:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!x y. (x INSERT s) DELETE y =
             if x = y then s DELETE y else x INSERT (s DELETE y)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
We may wish to perform a case-split using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>COND_CASES_TAC</SPAN>, but since variables
in the if-then-else construct are bound, this is inapplicable. Thus we want to
first strip off the universally quantified variables:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `(x INSERT s) DELETE y =
   (if x = y then s DELETE y else x INSERT (s DELETE y))`
</PRE></DIV>
and then apply <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>COND_CASES_TAC</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e COND_CASES_TAC;;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
A quicker way (starting again from the initial goal) would be to combine the
tactics using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>THEN</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC THEN COND_CASES_TAC);;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Although normally used to sequence tactics which generate a single subgoal,
it is worth remembering that it is sometimes useful to apply the same tactic
to multiple subgoals; sequences like the following:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   EQ_TAC THENL [ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]; ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]]
</PRE></DIV>
can be replaced by the briefer:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   EQ_TAC THEN ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]
</PRE></DIV>
If using this several times in succession, remember that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>THEN</SPAN> is
left-associative.
