<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Produces cofactors proving that one real polynomial is in the ideal generated
by others.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real_ideal_cofactors [`p1`; ...; `pn`] `p`</SPAN>, where all the terms have
type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:real</SPAN> and can be considered as polynomials, will test whether <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> is in
the ideal generated by the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p1,...,pn</SPAN>. If so, it will return a corresponding
list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[`q1`; ...; `qn`]</SPAN> of `cofactors' such that the following is an
algebraic identity (provable by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RING</SPAN> or a slight elaboration of
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_POLY_CONV</SPAN>, for example):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  p = p1 * q1 + ... + pn * qn
</PRE></DIV>
hence providing an explicit certificate for the ideal membership. If
ideal membership does not hold, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real_ideal_cofactors</SPAN> fails. The test is
performed using a Gr\"obner basis procedure.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the terms are ill-typed, or if ideal membership fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is a fairly simple example:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
 # prioritize_real();;
 val it : unit = ()

 # real_ideal_cofactors
   [`y1 * y3 + x1 * x3`;
    `y3 * (y2 - y3) + (x2 - x3) * x3`]
   `x3 * y3 * (y1 * (x2 - x3) - x1 * (y2 - y3))`;;
 ...
val it : term list = [`&amp;1 * y3 pow 2 + -- &amp;1 * y2 * y3`; `&amp;1 * y1 * y3`]
</PRE></DIV>
and we can confirm the identity as follows (note that
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_IDEAL_CONV</SPAN> already does this directly):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_RING `(&amp;1 * y3 pow 2 + -- &amp;1 * y2 * y3) * (y1 * y3 + x1 * x3) +
               (&amp;1 * y1 * y3) * (y3 * (y2 - y3) + (x2 - x3) * x3) =
               x3 * y3 * (y1 * (x2 - x3) - x1 * (y2 - y3))`;;
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
When we say that terms can be `considered as polynomials', we mean that initial
normalization, essentially in the style of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_POLY_CONV</SPAN>, will be applied,
but some complex constructs such as conditional expressions will be treated as
atomic.
