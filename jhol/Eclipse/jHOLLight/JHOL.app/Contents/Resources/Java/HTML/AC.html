<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>AC : thm -&gt; term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Proves equality of terms using associative, commutative, and optionally
idempotence laws.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Suppose <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>_</SPAN> is a function, which is assumed to be infix in the following
syntax, and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>acth</SPAN> is a theorem expressing associativity and commutativity in
the particular canonical form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   acth = |- m _ n = n _ m /\
             (m _ n) _ p = m _ n _ p /\
             m _ n _ p = n _ m _ p
</PRE></DIV>
Then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>AC acth</SPAN> will prove equations whose left and right sides can be
made identical using these associative and commutative laws. If the input
theorem also has idempotence property in this canonical form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- (p _ q = q _ p) /\
     ((p _ q) _ r = p _ q _ r) /\
     (p _ q _ r = q _ p _ r) /\
     (p _ p = p) /\
     (p _ p _ q = p _ q)
</PRE></DIV>
then idempotence will also be applied.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the terms are not proved equivalent under the appropriate laws. This
may happen because the input theorem does not have the correct canonical form.
The latter problem will not in itself cause failure until it is applied to the
term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # AC ADD_AC `1 + 2 + 3 = 2 + 1 + 3`;;
  val it : thm = |- 1 + 2 + 3 = 2 + 1 + 3
  # AC CONJ_ACI `p /\ (q /\ p) <=> (p /\ q) /\ (p /\ q)`;;
  val it : thm = |- p /\ q /\ p <=> (p /\ q) /\ p /\ q
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Note that pre-proved theorems in the correct canonical form for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>AC</SPAN> are
already present for many standard operators, e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ADD_AC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MULT_AC</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INT_ADD_AC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INT_MUL_AC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ADD_AC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_MUL_AC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONJ_ACI</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISJ_ACI</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INSERT_AC</SPAN>. The underlying algorithm is not particularly
delicate, and normalization under the associative/commutative/idempotent laws
can be achieved by direct rewriting with the same canonical theorems. For some
cases, specially optimized rules are available such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CONJ_ACI_RULE</SPAN> and
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISJ_ACI_RULE</SPAN>.
