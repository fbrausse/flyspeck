<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Exits HOL Light but saves current state ready to restart.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This is only available in Linux. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>checkpoint s</SPAN> calls the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>freeze</SPAN>
function from CryoPID to create a checkpoint of the current state of HOL Light,
named <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>hol.snapshot</SPAN>. When this image is restarted, the string <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN> is printed
as well as the usual startup banner.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, except in the face of OS-level problems such as running out of
disc space.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
To quickly save the state of HOL Light when it would take a long time to
regenerate.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Unfortunately I do not know of any checkpointing tool that can give this
behaviour under Windows or Mac OS X. See the README file and tutorial for
additional information on Linux checkpointing options.
