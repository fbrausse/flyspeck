<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>the_type_definitions : ((string * string * string) * (thm * thm)) list ref</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
List of type definitions made so far.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The reference variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>the_type_definitions</SPAN> holds a list of entries, one for
each type definition made so far with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_type_definition</SPAN>. It is not normally
explicitly manipulated by the user, but is automatically augmented by each call
of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_type_definition</SPAN>. Each entry contains three strings (the type name,
type constructor name and destructor name) and two theorems (the input
nonemptiness theorem and the returned type bijections). That is, for a call:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  bijth = new_type_definition tyname (absname,repname) nonempth;;
</PRE></DIV>
the entry created in this list is:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
 (tyname,absname,repname),(nonempth,bijth)
</PRE></DIV>
Note that the entries made using other interfaces to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_basic_type_definition</SPAN>, such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_type</SPAN>, are not included in this
list.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This is mainly intended for internal use in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_type_definition</SPAN>, so that
repeated instances of the same definition are ignored rather than rejected.
Some users may find the information useful too.
