<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Produces normalizer functions over a ring or even a semiring.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SEMIRING_NORMALIZERS_CONV</SPAN> should be given two theorems about
some binary operators that we write as infix `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>', `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>*</SPAN>' and `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>^</SPAN>' and
ground terms `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ZERO</SPAN>' and `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONE</SPAN>'. (The conventional symbols make the import of
the theorem easier to grasp, but they are essentially arbitrary.) The first
theorem is of the following form, essentially stating that the operators form a
semiring structure with `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>^</SPAN>' as the ``power'' operator:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- (!x y z. x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z) /\
     (!x y. x + y = y + x) /\
     (!x. ZERO + x = x) /\
     (!x y z. x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z) /\
     (!x y. x * y = y * x) /\
     (!x. ONE * x = x) /\
     (!x. ZERO * x = ZERO) /\
     (!x y z. x * (y + z) = x * y + x * z) /\
     (!x. x^0 = ONE) /\
     (!x n. x^(SUC n) = x * x^n)
</PRE></DIV>
The second theorem may just be <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>TRUTH = |- T</SPAN>, in which case it will be assumed
that the structure is just a semiring. Otherwise, it may be of the following
form for ``negation'' (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>neg</SPAN>) and ``subtraction'' functions, plus a
ground term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MINUS1</SPAN> thought of as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>-1</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- (!x. neg x = MINUS1 * x) /\
     (!x y. x - y = x + MINUS1 * y)
</PRE></DIV>
If the second theorem is provided, the eventual normalizer will also handle the
negation and subtraction operations. Generally this is beneficial, but is
impossible on structures like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:num</SPAN> with no negative numbers.

The remaining arguments are a tuple. The first is an ordering on terms, used to
determine the polynomial form. Normally, the default OCaml ordering is fine.
The rest are intended to be functions for operating on `constants' (e.g.
numerals), which should handle at least `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ZERO</SPAN>', `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONE</SPAN>' and, in the case of a
ring, `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MINUS1</SPAN>'. The functions are: (i) a test for membership in the set of
`constants', (ii) an addition conversion on constants, (iii) a multiplication
conversion on constants, and (iv) a conversion to raise a constant to a numeral
power. Note that no subtraction or negation operations are needed explicitly
because this is subsumed in the presence of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>-1</SPAN> as a constant.

The function then returns conversions for putting terms of the structure into a
canonical form, essentially multiplied-out polynomials with a particular
ordering. The functions respectively negate, add, subtract, multiply,
exponentiate terms already in the canonical form, putting the result back in
canonical form. The final return value is an overall normalization function.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the theorems are malformed.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
There are already instantiations of the main normalizer for natural numbers
(<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUM_NORMALIZE_CONV</SPAN>) and real numbers (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_POLY_CONV</SPAN>). Here is how the
latter is first constructed (it is later enhanced to handle some additional
functions more effectively, so use the inbuilt definition, not this one):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let REAL_POLY_NEG_CONV,REAL_POLY_ADD_CONV,REAL_POLY_SUB_CONV,
        REAL_POLY_MUL_CONV,REAL_POLY_POW_CONV,REAL_POLY_CONV =
      SEMIRING_NORMALIZERS_CONV REAL_POLY_CLAUSES REAL_POLY_NEG_CLAUSES
       (is_ratconst,
        REAL_RAT_ADD_CONV,REAL_RAT_MUL_CONV,REAL_RAT_POW_CONV)
       (<);;
  val ( REAL_POLY_NEG_CONV ) : term -> thm = <fun>
  val ( REAL_POLY_ADD_CONV ) : term -> thm = <fun>
  val ( REAL_POLY_SUB_CONV ) : term -> thm = <fun>
  val ( REAL_POLY_MUL_CONV ) : term -> thm = <fun>
  val ( REAL_POLY_POW_CONV ) : term -> thm = <fun>
  val ( REAL_POLY_CONV ) : term -> thm = <fun>
</PRE></DIV>
For examples of the resulting main function in action, see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_POLY_CONV</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This is a highly generic function, intended only for occasional use by experts.
Users reasoning in any sort of ring structure may find it a useful
building-block for a decision procedure.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This is a subcomponent of more powerful generic decision procedures such as
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RING</SPAN>. These can handle more sophisticated reasoning that direct equality
through normalization.
