<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Fail with empty string.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
In HOL Light, the class of exceptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Failure "string"</SPAN> is used consistently.
This makes it easy to catch all HOL-related exceptions by a <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Failure _</SPAN> pattern
without accidentally catching others. In general, the failure can be generated
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>failwith "string"</SPAN>, but the special case of an empty string is bound to the
function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fail</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Always fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Useful when there is no intention to propagate helpful information about the
cause of the exception, for example because you know it will be caught and
handled without discrimination.
