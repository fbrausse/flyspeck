<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Extends internal store of distinctness and injectivity theorems for a new
inductive type.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
HOL Light maintains several data structures based on the current set of
distinctness and injectivity theorems for the inductive data type so far
defined. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>extend_rectype_net ("tyname",(_,_,rth))</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rth</SPAN> is the
recursion theorem for the type as returned as the second item from
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_type</SPAN>, extend these structures for a new type. Two arguments are
ignored just for regularity with some other internal data structures.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, even if the theorem is malformed.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This function is called automatically by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_type</SPAN>, and normally users will
not need to invoke it explicitly.
