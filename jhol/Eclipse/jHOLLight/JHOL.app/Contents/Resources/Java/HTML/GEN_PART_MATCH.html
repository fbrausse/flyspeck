<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>GEN_PART_MATCH : (term -&gt; term) -&gt; thm -&gt; term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Instantiates a theorem by matching part of it to a term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a `selector' function of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term -> term</SPAN>, a theorem and a
term:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   GEN_PART_MATCH fn (A |- !x1...xn. t) tm
</PRE></DIV>
the function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_PART_MATCH</SPAN> applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t'</SPAN> (the result of
specializing universally quantified variables in the conclusion of the
theorem), and attempts to match the resulting term to the argument term
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>.  If it succeeds, the appropriately instantiated version of the
theorem is returned. Limited higher-order matching is supported, and some
attempt is made to maintain bound variable names in higher-order matching.
Unlike <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PART_MATCH</SPAN>, free variables in the initial theorem that are
unconstrained by the instantiation will be renamed if necessary to avoid
clashes with determined free variables.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the selector function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> fails when applied to the instantiated
theorem, or if the match fails with the term it has provided.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
See <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_MP_TAC</SPAN> for more basic examples. The following illustrates the
difference with that function
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let th = ARITH_RULE `m = n ==> m + p = n + p`;;
  val th : thm = |- m = n ==> m + p = n + p

  # PART_MATCH lhand th `n:num = p`;;
  val it : thm = |- n = p ==> n + p = p + p

  # GEN_PART_MATCH lhand th `n:num = p`;;
  val it : thm = |- n = p ==> n + p' = p + p'
</PRE></DIV>
