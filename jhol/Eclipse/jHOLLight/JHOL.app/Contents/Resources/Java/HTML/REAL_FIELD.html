<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>REAL_FIELD : term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Prove basic `field' facts over the reals.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Most of the built-in HOL arithmetic decision procedures have limited ability to
deal with inversion or division. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_FIELD</SPAN> is an enhancement of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RING</SPAN>
that has the same underlying method but first performs various case-splits,
reducing a goal involving the inverse <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>inv(t)</SPAN> of a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> to the cases where
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t = 0</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t * inv(t) = &amp;1</SPAN>, repeatedly for all such <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>. After
subsequently splitting the goal into normal form, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RING</SPAN> (for algebraic
reasoning) is applied; if this fails then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ARITH</SPAN> is also tried, since
this allows some <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t = 0</SPAN> cases to be excluded by simple linear reasoning.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the term is not provable using the methods described.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here we do some simple algebraic simplification, ruling out the degenerate
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x = &amp;0</SPAN> case using the inequality in the antecedent.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_FIELD `!x. &amp;0 < x ==> &amp;1 / x - &amp;1 / (x + &amp;1) = &amp;1 / (x * (x + &amp;1))`;;
  ...
  val it : thm = |- !x. &amp;0 < x ==> &amp;1 / x - &amp;1 / (x + &amp;1) = &amp;1 / (x * (x + &amp;1))
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Except for the discharge of conditions using linear reasoning, this rule is
essentially equational. For nonlinear inequality reasoning, there are no
powerful rules built into HOL Light, but the additional derived rules defined
in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Examples/sos.ml</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Rqe/make.ml</SPAN> may be useful.
