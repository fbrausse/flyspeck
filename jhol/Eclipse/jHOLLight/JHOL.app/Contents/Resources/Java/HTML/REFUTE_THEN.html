<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Assume the negation of the goal and apply theorem-tactic to it.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REFUTE_THEN ttac</SPAN> applied to a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>, assumes the negation of
the goal and applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to it and a similar goal with a conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>F</SPAN>.
More precisely, if the original goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- u</SPAN> is unnegated and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN>'s action
is
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
    A ?- F
   ========  ttac (ASSUME `~u`)
    B ?- v
</PRE></DIV>
then we have
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
     A ?- u
   ==============  REFUTE_THEN ttac
     B ?- v
</PRE></DIV>
For example, if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> is just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASSUME_TAC</SPAN>, this corresponds to a classic
`proof by contradiction':
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
         A ?- u
   =================  REFUTE_THEN ASSUME_TAC
    A u {~u} ?- F
</PRE></DIV>
Whatever <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> may be, if the conclusion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>u</SPAN> of the goal is negated, the
effect is the same except that the assumed theorem will not be double-negated,
so the effect is the same as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DISCH_THEN</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails unless the underlying theorem-tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> does.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Classical `proof by contradiction'.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
When applied to an unnegated goal, this tactic embodies implicitly the
classical principle of `proof by contradiction', but for negated goals the
tactic is also intuitionistically valid.
