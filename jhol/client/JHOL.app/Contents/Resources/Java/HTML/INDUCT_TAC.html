<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Performs tactical proof by mathematical induction on the natural numbers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INDUCT_TAC</SPAN> reduces a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- !n. P[n]</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> has type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>, to two
subgoals corresponding to the base and step cases in a proof by mathematical
induction on <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN>. The induction hypothesis appears among the assumptions of the
subgoal for the step case.  The specification of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INDUCT_TAC</SPAN> is:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
                A ?- !n. P
    ========================================  INDUCT_TAC
     A ?- P[0/n]     A u {P} ?- P[SUC n'/n]
</PRE></DIV>
where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n'</SPAN> is a primed variant of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> that does not appear free in
the assumptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> (usually, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n'</SPAN> is just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INDUCT_TAC g</SPAN> fails unless the conclusion of the goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN> has the form
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`!n. t`</SPAN>, where the variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> has type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we want to prove the classic `sum of the first <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> integers' theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!n. nsum(1..n) (\i. i) = (n * (n + 1)) DIV 2`;;
</PRE></DIV>
This is a classic example of an inductive proof. If we apply
induction, we get two subgoals:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e INDUCT_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 2 subgoals (2 total)

   0 [`nsum (1 .. n) (\i. i) = (n * (n + 1)) DIV 2`]

  `nsum (1 .. SUC n) (\i. i) = (SUC n * (SUC n + 1)) DIV 2`

  `nsum (1 .. 0) (\i. i) = (0 * (0 + 1)) DIV 2`
</PRE></DIV>
each of which can be solved by just:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(ASM_REWRITE_TAC[NSUM_CLAUSES_NUMSEG] THEN ARITH_TAC);;
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Essentially the same effect can be had by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_MP_TAC num_INDUCTION</SPAN>. This
does not subsequently break down the goal in such a convenient way, but gives
more control over choice of variable. You can also equally well use it for
other kinds of induction, e.g. use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_MP_TAC num_WF</SPAN> for wellfounded
(complete, noetherian) induction.
