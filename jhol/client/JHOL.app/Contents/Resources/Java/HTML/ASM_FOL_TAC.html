<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Fix up function arities for first-order proof search.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This function attempts to make the assumptions of a goal more `first-order'.
Functions that are not consistently used with the same arity, e.g. a function
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f</SPAN> that is sometimes applied <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f(a)</SPAN> and sometimes used as an argument to other
functions, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g(f)</SPAN>, will be identified. Applications of the function will then
be modified by the introduction of the identity function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>I</SPAN> (which can be
thought of later as binary `function application') so that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>f(a)</SPAN> becomes
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>I f a</SPAN>. This gives a more natural formulation as a prelude to traditional
first-order proof search.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This function is not intended for general use, but is part of the initial
normalization in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SEE ALSO</SPAN><DD>
<A href="MESON.html">MESON</A>, <A href="MESON_TAC.html">MESON_TAC</A>.
