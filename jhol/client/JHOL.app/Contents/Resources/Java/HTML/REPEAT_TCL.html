<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Repeatedly applies a theorem-tactical until it fails when applied to the
theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to a theorem-tactical, a theorem-tactic and a theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   REPEAT_TCL ttl ttac th
</PRE></DIV>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REPEAT_TCL</SPAN> repeatedly modifies the theorem according to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttl</SPAN>
until it fails when given to the theorem-tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails iff the theorem-tactic fails immediately when applied to the theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
It is often desirable to repeat the action of basic theorem-tactics. For
example <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CHOOSE_THEN</SPAN> strips off a single existential quantification, so one
might use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REPEAT_TCL CHOOSE_THEN</SPAN> to get rid of them all.

Alternatively, one might want to repeatedly break apart a theorem which is a
nested conjunction and apply the same theorem-tactic to each conjunct. For
example the following goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `(0 = w /\ 0 = x) /\ 0 = y /\ 0 = z ==> w + x + y + z = 0`;;
  Warning: Free variables in goal: w, x, y, z
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `(0 = w /\ 0 = x) /\ 0 = y /\ 0 = z ==> w + x + y + z = 0`
</PRE></DIV>
might be solved by
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(DISCH_THEN (REPEAT_TCL CONJUNCTS_THEN (SUBST1_TAC o SYM)) THEN
      REWRITE_TAC[ADD_CLAUSES]);;
</PRE></DIV>
