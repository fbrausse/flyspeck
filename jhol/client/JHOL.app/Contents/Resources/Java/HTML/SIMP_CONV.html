<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Simplify a term repeatedly by conditional contextual rewriting.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_CONV thl tm</SPAN> will return <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- tm = tm'</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm'</SPAN> results from
applying the theorems in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thl</SPAN> as (conditional) rewrite rules, as well as
built-in simplifications (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_convs</SPAN>).

The theorems are first split up into individual rewrite rules, either
conditional (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- c ==> l = r</SPAN>) or unconditional (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- l = r</SPAN>), as described in
the documentation for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_rewrites</SPAN>. These are then applied repeatedly to
replace subterms in the goal that are instances <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>l'</SPAN> of the left-hand side with
a corresponding <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>r'</SPAN>. Rewrite rules that are permutative, with each side an
instance of the other, have an ordering imposed on them so that they tend to
force terms into canonical form rather than looping (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ORDERED_REWR_CONV</SPAN>).
In the case of applying a conditional rewrite, the condition <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> needs to be
eliminated before the rewrite can be applied. This is attempted by recursively
applying the same simplifications to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> in the hope of reducing it to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>T</SPAN>. If
this can be done, the conditional rewrite is applied, otherwise not. To add
additional provers to dispose of side-conditions beyond application of the
basic rewrites, see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_prover</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ss_of_provers</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, but may return a reflexive theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- tm = tm</SPAN> if no
simplifications can be made.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here we use the conditional and contextual facilities:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # SIMP_CONV[SUB_ADD; ARITH_RULE `0 < n ==> 1 <= n`]
        `0 < n ==> (n - 1) + 1 = n + f(k + 1)`;;
  val it : thm =
  |- 0 < n ==> n - 1 + 1 = n + f (k + 1) <=> 0 < n ==> n = n + f (k + 1)
</PRE></DIV>
and here we show how a permutative rewrite achieves normalization
(the same would work with plain <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_CONV</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REWRITE_CONV[ADD_AC] `(a + c + e) + ((b + a + d) + e):num`;;
  val it : thm = |- (a + c + e) + (b + a + d) + e = a + a + b + c + d + e + e
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
For simply rewriting with unconditional equations, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_CONV</SPAN> and relatives
are simpler and more efficient.
