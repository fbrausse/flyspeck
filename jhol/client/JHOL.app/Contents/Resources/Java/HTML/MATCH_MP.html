<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Modus Ponens inference rule with automatic matching.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When applied to theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A1 |- !x1...xn. t1 ==> t2</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A2 |- t1'</SPAN>, the
inference rule <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_MP</SPAN> matches <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t1'</SPAN> by instantiating free or
universally quantified variables in the first theorem (only), and returns a
theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A1 u A2 |- !xa..xk. t2'</SPAN>, where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2'</SPAN> is a correspondingly
instantiated version of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t2</SPAN>. Polymorphic types are also instantiated if
necessary.

Variables free in the consequent but not the antecedent of the first argument
theorem will be replaced by variants if this is necessary to maintain the full
generality of the theorem, and any which were universally quantified over in
the first argument theorem will be universally quantified over in the result,
and in the same order.

</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails unless the first theorem is a (possibly repeatedly universally
quantified) implication whose antecedent can be instantiated to match
the conclusion of the second theorem, without instantiating any variables
which are free in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A1</SPAN>, the first theorem's assumption list.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
In this example, automatic renaming occurs to maintain the most general form of
the theorem, and the variant corresponding to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>z</SPAN> is universally quantified
over, since it was universally quantified over in the first argument theorem.
