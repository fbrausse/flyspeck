<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a goal including built-in tautologies in the list of rewrites.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Rewriting tactics in HOL provide a recursive left-to-right matching
and rewriting facility that automatically decomposes subgoals and
justifies segments of proof in which equational theorems are used,
singly or collectively.  These include the unfolding of definitions,
and the substitution of equals for equals.  Rewriting is used either
to advance or to complete the decomposition of subgoals.

<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> transforms (or solves) a goal by using as rewrite rules
(i.e. as left-to-right replacement rules) the conclusions of the given
list of (equational) theorems, as well as a set of built-in theorems
(common tautologies) held in the ML variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN>.
Recognition of a tautology often terminates the subgoaling process
(i.e. solves the goal).

The equational rewrites generated are applied recursively and to
arbitrary depth, with matching and instantiation of variables and type
variables.  A list of rewrites can set off an infinite rewriting
process, and it is not, of course, decidable in general whether a
rewrite set has that property. The order in which the rewrite theorems
are applied is unspecified, and the user should not depend on any
ordering.

See <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> for more details on the rewriting process.
Variants of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> allow the use of a different set of
rewrites. Some of them, such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>PURE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, exclude the basic
tautologies from the possible transformations. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> and
others include the assumptions at the goal in the set of possible
rewrites.

Still other tactics allow greater control over the search for
rewritable subterms. Several of them such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> do not
apply rewrites recursively. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> allows a rewrite to be
applied at a particular subterm.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> does not fail. Certain sets of rewriting theorems on
certain goals may cause a non-terminating sequence of rewrites.
Divergent rewriting behaviour results from a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> being
immediately or eventually rewritten to a term containing <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> as a
sub-term. The exact behaviour depends on the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>HOL</SPAN> implementation; it
may be possible (unfortunately) to fall into Lisp in this event.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The arithmetic theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GT</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- !n m. m > n <=> n < m</SPAN>, is used below to
advance a goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `4 < 5`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `4 < 5`

  # e(REWRITE_TAC[GT]);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `4 < 5`
</PRE></DIV>
It is used below with the theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>LT_0</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- !n. 0 < SUC n</SPAN>, to
solve a goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `SUC n > 0`;;
  Warning: Free variables in goal: n
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `SUC n > 0`

  # e(REWRITE_TAC[GT; LT_0]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Rewriting is a powerful and general mechanism in HOL, and an
important part of many proofs.  It relieves the user of the burden of
directing and justifying a large number of minor proof steps.
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> fits a forward proof sequence smoothly into the general
goal-oriented framework. That is, (within one subgoaling step) it
produces and justifies certain forward inferences, none of which are
necessarily on a direct path to the desired goal.

<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> may be more powerful a tactic than is needed in certain
situations; if efficiency is at stake, alternatives might be
considered.
