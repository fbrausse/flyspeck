<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>self_destruct : string -&gt; unit</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Exits HOL Light but saves current state ready to restart.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This operation is only available in HOL images created using checkpointing (as
in the default Linux build arising from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>make all</SPAN>), not when the HOL Light
sources have simply been loaded into the OCaml toplevel without checkpointing.
A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>self_destruct s</SPAN> will exit the current OCaml / HOL Light session, but
save the current state to an image <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>hol.snapshot</SPAN>. Users can then start this
image; it will display the usual banner and also the string <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s</SPAN>, and the user
will then be in the same state as before <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>self_destruct</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails, except in the face of OS-level problems such as running out of
disc space.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Very useful to start HOL Light quickly with many background theories or tools
loaded, rather than needing to rebuild them from sources.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Unfortunately I do not know of any checkpointing tool that can give this
behaviour under Windows or Mac OS X. See the README file and tutorial for
additional information on Linux checkpointing options.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose that all the proofs you are doing at the moment need more theorems
about prime numbers, and also a list of all prime numbers up to 1000. We reach
a suitable state:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # needs "Library/prime.ml";;
  ...
  # let primes_1000 = rev(rev_itlist
      (fun q ps -> if exists (fun p -> q mod p = 0) ps then ps else q::ps)
      (2--1000) []);;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
and now issue the checkpointing command:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  self_destruct "Preloaded with prime number material";;
</PRE></DIV>
HOL Light will exit and a new file <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>hol.snapshot</SPAN> will be created. You might
want to rename it as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>hol.prime</SPAN> in the OS so it has a more intuitive name and
doesn't get overwritten by later checkpoints
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  $ mv hol.snapshot hol.prime
</PRE></DIV>
You can then start the new image just by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>hol.prime</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  $ hol.prime
          HOL Light 2.10, built 16 March 2006 on OCaml 3.08.3
          Preloaded with prime number material

  val it : unit = ()
  #
</PRE></DIV>
and continue where you left off, with all the prime-number material
available instantly:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # PRIME_DIVPROD;;
  val it : thm =
    |- !p a b. prime p /\ p divides a * b ==> p divides a \/ p divides b
  # el 100 primes_1000;;
  val it : int = 547
</PRE></DIV>
