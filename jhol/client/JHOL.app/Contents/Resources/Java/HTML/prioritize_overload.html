<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Give overloaded constants involving a given type priority in operator
overloading.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
In general, overloaded operators in the concrete syntax, such as `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>+</SPAN>', are
ambiguous, referring to one of several underlying constants. The choice is
normally made based on some known types, or the presence of operators that are
not overloaded for the number systems. (For example, numerals like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>42</SPAN> are
always assumed to be of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num</SPAN>, while the division operator `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>/</SPAN>' is only
defined for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real</SPAN>.) In the absence of any such indication, a default choice
will be made. The effect of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prioritize_overload `:ty`</SPAN> is to run through the
overloaded symbols making the first instance of each where the generic type
variables in the type skeleton are replaced by type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`:ty`</SPAN> the first priority
when no other indication is made.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
With real priority, most things are interpreted as type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>real</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # prioritize_overload `:real`;;
  val it : unit = ()

  # type_of `x + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:real`
</PRE></DIV>
By making <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>int</SPAN> the priority, everything is interpreted as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>int</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # prioritize_overload `:int`;;
  val it : unit = ()

  # type_of `x + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:int`
</PRE></DIV>
unless there is some explicit type information to the contrary:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # type_of `(x:real) + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:real`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
It is perhaps better practice to insert types explicitly to avoid dependence on
such defaults, otherwise proofs can become context-dependent. However it is
often very convenient.
