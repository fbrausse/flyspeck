<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Basic rewriting conversion restricted by term order.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given an ordering relation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ord</SPAN>, an equational theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A |- !x1...xn. s = t</SPAN>
that expresses a rewrite rule, the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ORDERED_REWR_CONV</SPAN> gives a
conversion that applied to any term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s'</SPAN> will attempt to match the left-hand
side of the equation <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s = t</SPAN> to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>s'</SPAN>, and return the corresponding theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A
|- s' = t'</SPAN>, but only if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ord `s'` `t'`</SPAN>, i.e. if the left-hand side is
``greater'' in the ordering than the right-hand side, after instantiation. If
the ordering condition is violated, it will fail, even if the match is fine.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the theorem is not of the right form or the two terms cannot be
matched, for example because the variables that need to be instantiated are
free in the hypotheses <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>, or if the ordering requirement fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
We apply the permutative rewrite:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ADD_SYM;;
  val it : thm = |- !m n. m + n = n + m
</PRE></DIV>
with the default term ordering <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_order</SPAN> designed for this kind of
application. Note that it applies in one direction:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ORDERED_REWR_CONV term_order ADD_SYM `1 + 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- 1 + 2 = 2 + 1
</PRE></DIV>
but not the other:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ORDERED_REWR_CONV term_order ADD_SYM `2 + 1`;;
  Exception: Failure "ORDERED_REWR_CONV: wrong orientation".
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Applying conditional rewrite rules that are permutative and would loop without
some restriction. Thanks to the fact that higher-level rewriting operations
like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_CONV</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> have ordering built in for permutative
rewrite rules, rewriting with theorem like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ADD_AC</SPAN> will effectively normalize
terms.
