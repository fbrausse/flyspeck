<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Change the rewrite maker in a simpset.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN>) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process
theorems into rewrites. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ss_of_maker maker ss</SPAN> changes the ``rewrite
maker'' in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ss</SPAN> to yield a new simpset; use of this simpset with additional
theorems will process those theorems using the new rewrite maker. The default
rewrite maker is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_rewrites</SPAN> with an appropriate flag, and it is unusual to
want to change it.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.
