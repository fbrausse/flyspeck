<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>SUBST1_TAC : thm_tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Makes a simple term substitution in a goal using a single equational theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- u = v</SPAN> and a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(A ?- t)</SPAN>, the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST1_TAC (A'
|- u = v)</SPAN> rewrites the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> into <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t[v/u]</SPAN>, by substituting <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN> for each
free occurrence of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>u</SPAN> in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
      A ?- t
   =============  SUBST1_TAC (A' |- u = v)
    A ?- t[v/u]
</PRE></DIV>
The assumptions of the theorem used to substitute with are not added
to the assumptions of the goal but are recorded in the proof.  If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A'</SPAN> is not a
subset of the assumptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> of the goal (up to alpha-conversion), then
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST1_TAC (A' |- u = v)</SPAN> results in an invalid tactic. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST1_TAC</SPAN>
automatically renames bound variables to prevent free variables in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN> becoming
bound after substitution. However, by contrast with rewriting tactics such as
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, it does not instantiate free or universally quantified variables
in the theorem to make them match the target term. This makes it less powerful
but also more precisely controlled.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST1_TAC th (A ?- t)</SPAN> fails if the conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is not an equation.
No change is made to the goal if no free occurrence of the left-hand side
of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> appears in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we start with the goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!p x y. 1 = x /\ p(1) ==> p(x)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
We could, of course, solve it immediately with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC[]</SPAN>. However, for a
more ``manual'' proof, we might do:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT STRIP_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`1 = x`]
   1 [`p 1`]

  `p x`
</PRE></DIV>
and then use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST1_TAC</SPAN> to substitute:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(FIRST_X_ASSUM(SUBST1_TAC o SYM));;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`p 1`]

  `p 1`
</PRE></DIV>
after which just <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_REWRITE_TAC[]</SPAN> will finish.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SUBST1_TAC</SPAN> can be used when rewriting with a single theorem using tactics
such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> is too expensive or would diverge.
