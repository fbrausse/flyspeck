<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Prove existence of recursive function over inductive type.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This function has essentially the same interface and functionality as
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_recursive_definition</SPAN>, but it merely proves the existence of the function
rather than defining it.

The first argument to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN> is the primitive
recursion theorem for the concrete type in question; this is normally the
second theorem obtained from <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>define_type</SPAN>. The second argument is a term
giving the desired primitive recursive function definition. The value returned
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN> is a theorem stating the existence of a
function satisfying the `definition' clauses. This theorem is derived by formal
proof from an instance of the general primitive recursion theorem given as the
second argument.

Let <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>C1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Cn</SPAN> be the constructors of this type, and let `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(Ci vs)</SPAN>'
represent a (curried) application of the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th constructor to a sequence of
variables.  Then a curried primitive recursive function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> over <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ty</SPAN> can be
specified by a conjunction of (optionally universally-quantified) clauses of
the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   fn v1 ... (C1 vs1) ... vm  =  body1   /\
   fn v1 ... (C2 vs2) ... vm  =  body2   /\
                             .
                             .
   fn v1 ... (Cn vsn) ... vm  =  bodyn
</PRE></DIV>
where the variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v1</SPAN>, ..., <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vm</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vs</SPAN> are distinct in each
clause, and where in the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th clause <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> appears (free) in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>bodyi</SPAN> only
as part of an application of the form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   `fn t1 ... v ... tm`
</PRE></DIV>
in which the variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>v</SPAN> of type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ty</SPAN> also occurs among the
variables <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>vsi</SPAN>.

If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><definition></SPAN> is a conjunction of clauses, as described above, then
evaluating:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   prove_recursive_functions_exist th `<definition>`;;
</PRE></DIV>
automatically proves the existence of a function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> that satisfies
the defining equations supplied, and returns a theorem:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  |- ?fn. <definition>
</PRE></DIV>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN> also allows the supplied definition to omit
clauses for any number of constructors.  If a defining equation for the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>i</SPAN>th
constructor is omitted, then the value of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN> at that constructor:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   fn v1 ... (Ci vsi) ... vn
</PRE></DIV>
is left unspecified (<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>fn</SPAN>, however, is still a total function).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the clauses cannot be matched up with the recursion theorem. You may
find that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> still works in such cases.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here we show that there exists a product function:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  prove_recursive_functions_exist num_RECURSION
   `(prod f 0 = 1) /\ (!n. prod f (SUC n) = f(SUC n) * prod f n)`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- ?prod. prod f 0 = 1 /\ (!n. prod f (SUC n) = f (SUC n) * prod f n)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Often <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_general_recursive_function_exists</SPAN> is an easier route to the same
goal. Its interface is simpler (no need to specify the recursion theorem) and
it is more powerful. However, for suitably constrained definitions
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN> works well and is much more efficient.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
It is more usual to want to actually make definitions of recursive functions.
However, if a recursive function is needed in the middle of a proof, and seems
to ad-hoc for general use, you may just use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prove_recursive_functions_exist</SPAN>,
perhaps adding the ``definition'' as an assumption of the goal with
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CHOOSE_TAC</SPAN>.
