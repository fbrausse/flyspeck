<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Automated tactic for elementary divisibility properties over the natural
numbers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUMBER_TAC</SPAN> is a partly heuristic tactic that can often
automatically prove elementary ``divisibility'' properties of the natural
numbers. The precise subset that is dealt with is difficult to describe
rigorously, but many universally quantified combinations of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>divides</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>coprime</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>gcd</SPAN> and congruences <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(x == y) (mod n)</SPAN> can be proved
automatically, as well as some existentially quantified goals. See the
documentation for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INTEGER_RULE</SPAN> for a larger set of representative examples.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is not accessible to the methods used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
A typical elementary divisibility property is that if two numbers are congruent
with respect to two coprime (without non-trivial common factors) moduli, then
they are congruent with respect to their product:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!m n x y:num. (x == y) (mod m) /\ (x == y) (mod n) /\ coprime(m,n)
                     ==> (x == y) (mod (m * n))`;;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
It can be solved automatically using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUMBER_TAC</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e NUMBER_TAC;;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>
The analogous goal without the coprimality assumption will fail, and indeed the
goal would be false without it.
