<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>MATCH_CONV : term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Expands application of pattern-matching construct to particular case.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_CONV</SPAN> will reduce the application of a pattern to a
specific argument, either for a term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>match x with ...</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(function ...) x</SPAN>.
In the case of a sequential pattern, the first match will be reduced, resulting
either in a conditional expression or simply one of the cases if it can be
deduced just from the pattern. In the case of a single pattern, it will be
reduced immediately.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_CONV tm</SPAN> fails if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> is neither of the two applications of a pattern
to an argument.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
In cases where the structure of the argument determines the match, a complete
reduction is performed:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # MATCH_CONV `match [1;2;3;4;5] with CONS x (CONS y z) -> z`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (match [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] with CONS x (CONS y z) -> z) = [3; 4; 5]
</PRE></DIV>
However, only one reduction is performed for a sequential match:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # MATCH_CONV `(function [] -> 0 | CONS h t -> h + 1) [1;2;3;4]`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (function [] -> 0 | CONS h t -> h + 1) [1; 2; 3; 4] =
       (function CONS h t -> h + 1) [1; 2; 3; 4]
</PRE></DIV>
so the conversion may need to be repeated:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # TOP_DEPTH_CONV MATCH_CONV
     `(function [] -> 0 | CONS h t -> h + 1) [1;2;3;4]`;;
  val it : thm = |- (function [] -> 0 | CONS h t -> h + 1) [1; 2; 3; 4] = 1 + 1
</PRE></DIV>
In cases where the structure of the argument cannot be determined, a
conditional expression or other more involved result may be returned:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # MATCH_CONV `(function [] -> 0 | CONS h t -> h + 1) l`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (function [] -> 0 | CONS h t -> h + 1) l =
       (if [] = l then (function [] -> 0) l else (function CONS h t -> h + 1) l)
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
The simple cases where the structure completely determines the result are built
into the default rewrites, though nothing will happen in more general cases,
even if the conditions can be discharged straightforwardly, e.g:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REWRITE_CONV[] `match [1;2;3] with CONS h t when h = 1  -> h + LENGTH t`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (match [1; 2; 3] with CONS h t when h = 1 -> h + LENGTH t) =
       1 + LENGTH [2; 3]
  # REWRITE_CONV[] `match [1;2;3] with CONS h t when h < 7 -> h + LENGTH t`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (match [1; 2; 3] with CONS h t when h < 7 -> h + LENGTH t) =
       (match [1; 2; 3] with CONS h t when h < 7 -> h + LENGTH t)
</PRE></DIV>
