<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Augments a prover's context with new theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The HOL Light simplifier (e.g. as invoked by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN>) allows provers of type
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>prover</SPAN> to be installed into simpsets, to automatically dispose of
side-conditions. These may maintain a state dynamically and augment it as more
theorems become available (e.g. a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p |- p</SPAN> becomes available when
simplifying the consequent of an implication <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>`p ==> q`</SPAN>). In order to allow
maximal flexibility in the data structure used to maintain state, provers are
set up in an `object-oriented' style, where the context is part of the prover
function itself. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>augment p thl</SPAN> maps a prover <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> to a new prover with
theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thl</SPAN> added to the initial state.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails unless the prover is abnormal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This is mostly for experts wishing to customize the simplifier.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
I learned of this ingenious trick for maintaining context from Don Syme, who
discovered it by reading some code written by Richard Boulton. I was told by
Simon Finn that there are similar ideas in the functional language literature
for simulating existential types.
