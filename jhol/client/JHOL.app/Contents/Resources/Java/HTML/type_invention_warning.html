<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>type_invention_warning : bool ref</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Determined if user is warned about invented type variables.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
If HOL Light is unable to assign specific types to a term entered in quotation,
it will invent its own type variables to use in the most general type. The flag
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>type_invention_warning</SPAN> determines whether the user is warned in such
situations. The default is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>, since this can often indicate a user error
(e.g. the user forgot to define a constant before using it in a term or
overlooked more general types than expected). But to disable the warnings, set
it to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>false</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
When the following term is entered, HOL Light invents a type variable to use as
the most general type:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let tm = `x IN s`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val tm : term = `x IN s`
</PRE></DIV>
which are not particularly intuitive, as you can see:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # map dest_var (frees tm);;
  val it : (string * hol_type) list =
    [("x", `:?47676`); ("s", `:?47676->bool`)]
</PRE></DIV>
You can avoid this by explicitly giving appropriate types or type
variables yourself:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let tm = `(x:A) IN s`;;
  val tm : term = `x IN s`
</PRE></DIV>
But if you often want to let HOL Light invent types for itself without warning
you, set
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # type_invention_warning := false;;
  val it : unit = ()
</PRE></DIV>
One reason why you might find the warning more irritating than helpful is if
you are rewriting with ad-hoc set theory lemmas generated like this:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # SET_RULE `x IN UNIONS (a INSERT t) <=> x IN UNIONS t \/ x IN a`;;
</PRE></DIV>
