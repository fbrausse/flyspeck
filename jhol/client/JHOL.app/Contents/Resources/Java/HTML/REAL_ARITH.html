<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Attempt to prove term using basic algebra and linear arithmetic over the reals.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ARITH</SPAN> is the basic tool for proving elementary lemmas about real
equations and inequalities. Given a term, it first applies various
normalizations, eliminating constructs such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>max</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>min</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>abs</SPAN> by
introducing case splits, splitting over the arms of conditionals and putting
any equations and inequalities into a form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p(x) <><> 0</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><><></SPAN> is an
equality or inequality function and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p(x)</SPAN> is in a normal form for polynomials
as produced by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_POLY_CONV</SPAN>. The problem is split into the refutation of
various conjunctions of such subformulas. A refutation of each is attempted
using simple linear inequality reasoning (essentially Fourier-Motzkin
elimination). Note that no non-trivial nonlinear inequality reasoning is
performed (see below).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the term is not provable using the algorithm sketched above.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is some simple inequality reasoning, showing how constructs like <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>abs</SPAN>,
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>max</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>min</SPAN> can be handled:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_ARITH
      `abs(x) < min e d / &amp;2 /\ abs(y) < min e d / &amp;2 ==> abs(x + y) < d + e`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- abs x < min e d / &amp;2 /\ abs y < min e d / &amp;2 ==> abs (x + y) < d + e
</PRE></DIV>
The following example also involves inequality reasoning, but the initial
algebraic normalization is critical to make the pieces match up:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # REAL_ARITH `(&amp;1 + x) * (&amp;1 - x) * (&amp;1 + x pow 2) < &amp;1 ==> &amp;0 < x pow 4`;;
  val it : thm = |- (&amp;1 + x) * (&amp;1 - x) * (&amp;1 + x pow 2) < &amp;1 ==> &amp;0 < x pow 4
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Very convenient for providing elementary lemmas that would otherwise be painful
to prove manually.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
For nonlinear equational reasoning, use <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_RING</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_FIELD</SPAN>. For
nonlinear inequality reasoning, there are no powerful rules built into HOL
Light, but the additional derived rules defined in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Examples/sos.ml</SPAN> and
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Rqe/make.ml</SPAN> may be useful.
