<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_THM_THEN</SPAN> applies the given theorem-tactic using the result of
stripping off one outer connective from the given theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem-tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN>, a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> whose conclusion is a
conjunction, a disjunction or an existentially quantified term, and a goal
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(A,t)</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_THM_THEN ttac th</SPAN> first strips apart the conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>,
next applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to the theorem(s) resulting from the stripping and then
applies the resulting tactic to the goal.

In particular, when stripping a conjunctive theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- u /\ v</SPAN>, the tactic
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   ttac(u |- u) THEN ttac(v |- v)
</PRE></DIV>
resulting from applying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to the conjuncts, is applied to the
goal.  When stripping a disjunctive theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- u \/ v</SPAN>, the tactics
resulting from applying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to the disjuncts, are applied to split the goal
into two cases. That is, if
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
    A ?- t                           A ?- t
   =========  ttac (u |- u)    and    =========  ttac (v |- v)
    A ?- t1                          A ?- t2
</PRE></DIV>
then:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
         A ?- t
   ==================  STRIP_THM_THEN ttac (A' |- u \/ v)
    A ?- t1  A ?- t2
</PRE></DIV>
When stripping an existentially quantified theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- ?x.u</SPAN>, the
tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac(u |- u)</SPAN>, resulting from applying <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> to the body of the
existential quantification, is applied to the goal.  That is, if:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
    A ?- t
   =========  ttac (u |- u)
    A ?- t1
</PRE></DIV>
then:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
      A ?- t
   =============  STRIP_THM_THEN ttac (A' |- ?x. u)
      A ?- t1
</PRE></DIV>
The assumptions of the theorem being split are not added to the assumptions of
the goal(s) but are recorded in the proof.  If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A'</SPAN> is not a subset of the
assumptions <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN> of the goal (up to alpha-conversion), <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_THM_THEN ttac th</SPAN>
results in an invalid tactic.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_THM_THEN ttac th</SPAN> fails if the conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is not a conjunction,
a disjunction or an existentially quantified term.  Failure also occurs if the
application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ttac</SPAN> fails, after stripping the outer connective from the
conclusion of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>STRIP_THM_THEN</SPAN> is used enrich the assumptions of a goal with a stripped
version of a previously-proved theorem.
