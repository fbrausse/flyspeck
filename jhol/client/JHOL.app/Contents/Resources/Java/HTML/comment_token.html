<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
HOL Light comment token.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Users may insert comments in HOL Light terms that are ignored in parsing.
Comments are introduced by a special comment token and terminated by the next
end of line. (There are no multi-line comments supported in HOL Light terms.)
The reference <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>comment_token</SPAN> stores the token that introduces a comment, which
by default is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Resword "//"</SPAN> as in BCPL, C++, Java etc. The user may change it
to another token, though this should be done with care in case other proofs
break.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here we change the comment token to be `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>--</SPAN>' (as used in Ada, Eiffel, Haskell,
Occam and several other programming languages):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # comment_token := Ident "--";;
  val it : unit = ()
</PRE></DIV>
and we can test that it works:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # `let wordsize = 32 -- may change to 64 later
     and radix = 2     -- only care about binary
     in radix EXP wordsize`;;
  val it : term = `let wordsize = 32 and radix = 2 in radix EXP wordsize`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Comments are handled at the level of the lexical analyzer, so can also be used
in types and the strings used for the specification of inductive types.
