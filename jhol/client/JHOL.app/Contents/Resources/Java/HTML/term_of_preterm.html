<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>term_of_preterm : preterm -&gt; term</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Converts a preterm into a term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
HOL Light uses ``pretypes'' and ``preterms'' as intermediate structures for
parsing and typechecking, which are later converted to types and terms. A call
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>term_of_preterm ptm</SPAN> attempts to convert preterm <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ptm</SPAN> into a HOL term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if some constants used in the preterm have not been defined, or if there
are other inconsistencies in the types so that a consistent typing cannot be
arrived at.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Only users seeking to change HOL's parser and typechecker quite radically need
to use this function.
