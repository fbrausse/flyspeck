<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Returns a `fresh' variable with specified type.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When given a type, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>genvar</SPAN> returns a variable of that type whose name has not
previously been produced by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>genvar</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following indicates the typical stylized form of the names (this should
not be relied on, of course):
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # genvar `:bool`;;
  val it : term = `_56799`
</PRE></DIV>
There is no guard against users' own variables clashing, but if the user avoids
names in the same lexical style, that can be guaranteed.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
The unique variables are useful in writing derived rules, for specializing
terms without having to worry about such things as free variable capture.
If the names are to be visible to a typical user, the function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>variant</SPAN> can
provide rather more meaningful names.
