<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC : thm_tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Solves a goal which is an instance of the supplied theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
When given a theorem <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A' |- t</SPAN> and a goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- t'</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> can be matched
to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t'</SPAN> by instantiating variables which are either free or
universally quantified at the outer level, including appropriate type
instantiation, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC</SPAN> completely solves the goal.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
    A ?- t'
   =========  MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC (A' |- t)

</PRE></DIV>
Unless <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A'</SPAN> is a subset of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A</SPAN>, this is an invalid tactic.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails unless the theorem has a conclusion which is instantiable to match that
of the goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following example shows variable and type instantiation at work. Suppose we
have the following simple goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `HD [1;2] = 1`;;
</PRE></DIV>
we can do it via the polymorphic theorem
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>HD = |- !h t. HD(CONS h t) = h</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC HD);;
</PRE></DIV>
