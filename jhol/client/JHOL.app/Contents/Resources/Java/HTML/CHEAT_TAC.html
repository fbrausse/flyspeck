<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Proves goal by asserting it as an axiom.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Given any goal <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>A ?- p</SPAN>, the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>CHEAT_TAC</SPAN> solves it by using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_thm</SPAN>,
which in turn involves essentially asserting the goal as a new axiom.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Temporarily plugging boring parts of a proof to deal with the interesting
parts.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Needless to say, this should be used with caution since once new axioms are
asserted there is no guarantee that logical consistency is preserved.
