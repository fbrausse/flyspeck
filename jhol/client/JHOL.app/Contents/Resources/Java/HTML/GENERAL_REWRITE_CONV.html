<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrite with theorems as well as an existing net.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GENERAL_REWRITE_CONV b cnvl net thl</SPAN> will regard <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thl</SPAN> as rewrite
rules, and if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>b = true</SPAN>, also potentially as conditional rewrite rules. These
extra rules will be incorporated into the existing <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net</SPAN>, and rewriting applied
with a search strategy <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>cnvl</SPAN> (e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DEPTH_CONV</SPAN>).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
This is mostly for internal use, but it can sometimes be more efficient when
rewriting with large sets of theorems repeatedly if they are first composed
into a net and then augmented like this.
