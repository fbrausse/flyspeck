<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Produces cofactors proving that one integer polynomial is in the ideal
generated by others.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>int_ideal_cofactors [`p1`; ...; `pn`] `p`</SPAN>, where all the terms have
type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>:int</SPAN> and can be considered as polynomials, will test whether <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p</SPAN> is in
the ideal generated by the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>p1,...,pn</SPAN>. If so, it will return a corresponding
list <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>[`q1`; ...; `qn`]</SPAN> of `cofactors' such that the following is an algebraic
identity provable by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INT_RING</SPAN> or a slight elaboration of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INT_POLY_CONV</SPAN>, for
example)
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  p = p1 * q1 + ... + pn * qn
</PRE></DIV>
hence providing an explicit certificate for the ideal membership. If
ideal membership does not hold, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>int_ideal_cofactors</SPAN> fails. The test is
performed using a Gr\"obner basis procedure.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the terms are ill-typed, or if ideal membership fails. At present this
is a generic version for fields, and in rare cases it may fail because
cofactors are found involving non-trivial rational numbers even where there are
integer cofactors. This imperfection should be fixed eventually, and is not
usually a problem in practice.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
In the case of a singleton list, ideal membership just amounts to polynomial
divisibility, e.g.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # prioritize_int();;
  val it : unit = ()

  # int_ideal_cofactors
     [`r * x * (&amp;1 - x) - x`]
     `r * (r * x * (&amp;1 - x)) * (&amp;1 - r * x * (&amp;1 - x)) - x`;;
  [`&amp;1 * r pow 2 * x pow 2 +
    -- &amp;1 * r pow 2 * x +
    -- &amp;1 * r * x +
    &amp;1 * r +
    &amp;1`]
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
When we say that terms can be `considered as polynomials', we mean that initial
normalization, essentially in the style of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INT_POLY_CONV</SPAN>, will be applied,
but some complex constructs such as conditional expressions will be treated as
atomic.
