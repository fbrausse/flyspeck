<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Insert a theorem into a net as a (conditional) rewrite.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The underlying machinery in rewriting and simplification assembles
(conditional) rewrite rules and other conversions into a net, including a
priority number so that, for example, pure rewrites get applied before
conditional rewrites. Such a net can then be used by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITES_CONV</SPAN>. A call
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net_of_thm rf th net</SPAN> where <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> is a pure or conditional equation (as
constructed by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_rewrites</SPAN>, for example) will insert that rewrite rule into
the net with priority 1 (the highest) for a pure rewrite or 3 for a
conditional rewrite, to yield an updated net.

If <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>rf</SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN>, it indicates that this net will be used for repeated
rewriting (e.g. as in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_CONV</SPAN> rather than <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_CONV</SPAN>), and
therefore equations are simply discarded without changing the net if the LHS
occurs free in the RHS. This does not exclude more complicated looping
situations, but is still useful.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails on a theorem that is neither a pure nor conditional equation.
