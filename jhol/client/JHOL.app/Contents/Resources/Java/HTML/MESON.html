<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>MESON : thm list -&gt; term -&gt; thm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Attempt to prove a term by first-order proof search.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON[theorems] `tm`</SPAN> will attempt to prove <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> using pure first-order
reasoning, taking <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>theorems</SPAN> as the starting-point. It will usually either
solve the goal completely or run for an infeasible length of time before
terminating, but it may sometimes fail quickly.

Although <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> is capable of some fairly non-obvious pieces of first-order
reasoning, and will handle equality adequately, it does purely logical
reasoning. It will exploit no special properties of the constants in the goal,
other than equality and logical primitives. Any properties that are needed must
be supplied explicitly in the theorem list, e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>LE_REFL</SPAN> to tell it that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><=</SPAN>
on natural numbers is reflexive, or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ADD_SYM</SPAN> to tell it that addition on
real numbers is symmetric.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Will fail if the term is not provable, but not necessarily in a feasible amount
of time.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
A typical application is to prove some elementary logical lemma for use inside
a tactic proof:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # MESON[] `!P. P F /\ P T ==> !x. P x`;;
  ...
  val it : thm = |- !P. P F /\ P T ==> (!x. P x)
</PRE></DIV>
To prove the following lemma, we need to provide the key property of real
negation:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # MESON[REAL_NEG_NEG] `(!x. P(--x)) ==> !x:real. P x`;;
  ...
  val it : thm = |- (!x. P (--x)) ==> (!x. P x)
</PRE></DIV>
If the lemma is not supplied, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> will fail:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # MESON[] `(!x. P(--x)) ==> !x:real. P x`;;
  ...
  Exception: Failure "solve_goal: Too deep".
</PRE></DIV>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> is also capable of proving less straightforward results; see the
documentation for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN> to find more examples.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Generating simple logical lemmas as part of a large proof.
