<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Empty term net.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Term nets (type <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a net</SPAN>) are a lookup structure associating objects of type
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>'a</SPAN>, e.g. conversions, with a corresponding `pattern' term. For a given term,
one can then relatively quickly look up all objects whose pattern terms might
possibly match to it. This is used, for example, in rewriting to quickly filter
out obviously inapplicable rewrites rather than attempting each one in turn.
The (polymorphic) object <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>empty_net</SPAN> is the term net with no objects defined;
it can then be augmented by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>enter</SPAN> or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>merge_nets</SPAN> and used in <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>lookup</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
