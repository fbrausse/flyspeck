<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
List of all constant specifications introduced so far.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The reference variable <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>the_specifications</SPAN> holds the list of constant
specifications made so far by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>new_specification</SPAN>. It is a list of triples,
with the first two components being the list of variables and the existential
theorem used as input, and the last being the returned theorem.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Not applicable.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
This list is not logically necessary and is not part of HOL Light's logical
core, but it is used outside the core so that multiple instances of the same
specification are quietly ``ignored'' rather than rejected. (By contrast, the
list of new constants introduced by definitions is logically necessary to avoid
inconsistent redefinition.) Users may also sometimes find it convenient.
