<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Automated first-order proof search tactic.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A call to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC[theorems]</SPAN> will attempt to establish the current goal
using pure first-order reasoning, taking <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>theorems</SPAN> as the starting-point. (It
does not take the assumptions of the goal into account, but the similar
function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_MESON_TAC</SPAN> does.) It will usually either solve the goal
completely or run for an infeasible length of time before terminating, but it
may sometimes fail quickly.

Although <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN> is capable of some fairly non-obvious pieces of
first-order reasoning, and will handle equality adequately, it does purely
logical reasoning. It will exploit no special properties of the constants in
the goal, other than equality and logical primitives. Any properties that are
needed must be supplied explicitly in the theorem list, e.g. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>LE_REFL</SPAN> to tell
it that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT><=</SPAN> on natural numbers is reflexive, or <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REAL_ADD_SYM</SPAN> to tell it that
addition on real numbers is symmetric.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is unprovable within the search bounds, though not
necessarily in a feasible amount of time.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Here is a simple logical property taken from Dijstra's EWD 1062-1, which we set
as our goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `(!x. x <= x) /\
       (!x y z. x <= y /\ y <= z ==> x <= z) /\
       (!x y. f(x) <= y <=> x <= g(y))
       ==> (!x y. x <= y ==> f(x) <= f(y))`;;
</PRE></DIV>
It is solved quickly by:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(MESON_TAC[]);;
  0..0..1..3..8..17..solved at 25
  CPU time (user): 0.
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>
Note however that the proof did not rely on any special features of `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT><=</SPAN>'; any
binary relation symbol would have worked. Even simple proofs that rely on
special properties of the constants need to have those properties supplied in
the list. Note also that <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN> is limited to essentially first-order
reasoning, meaning that it cannot invent higher-order quantifier
instantiations. Thus, it cannot prove the following, which involves a
quantification over a function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>g</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
 # g `!f:A->B s.
        (!x y. x IN s /\ y IN s /\ (f x = f y) ==> (x = y)) <=>
        (?g. !x. x IN s ==> (g(f(x)) = x))`;;
</PRE></DIV>
However, we can manually reduce it to two subgoals:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC THEN MATCH_MP_TAC EQ_TRANS THEN
      EXISTS_TAC `?g:B->A. !y x. x IN s /\ y = f x ==> g y = x` THEN
      CONJ_TAC THENL
       [REWRITE_TAC[GSYM SKOLEM_THM]; AP_TERM_TAC THEN ABS_TAC]);;
  val it : goalstack = 2 subgoals (2 total)

  `(!y x. x IN s /\ y = f x ==> g y = x) <=> (!x. x IN s ==> g (f x) = x)`

  `(!x y. x IN s /\ y IN s /\ f x = f y ==> x = y) <=>
   (!y. ?g. !x. x IN s /\ y = f x ==> g = x)`
</PRE></DIV>
and both of those are solvable directly by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC[]</SPAN>.
