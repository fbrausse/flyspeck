<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Performs wellfounded induction with respect to a given `measure'.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>WF_INDUCT_TAC</SPAN> is applied to two arguments. The second is a goal to
prove, and the first is an expression to use as a ``measure''. The result is a
new subgoal where the same goal is to be proved but as an assumption it holds
for all smaller values of the measure, universally quantified over the free
variables in the measure term (which should also be free in the goal).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Suppose we define a Euclidean GCD algorithm:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let egcd = define
     `egcd(m,n) = if m = 0 then n
                  else if n = 0 then m
                  else if m <= n then egcd(m,n - m)
                  else egcd(m - n,n)`;;
</PRE></DIV>
and after picking up from the library an infix `<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>divides</SPAN>' relation
for divisibility:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # needs "Library/prime.ml";;
</PRE></DIV>
we want to prove something about the result, e.g.
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!m n d. d divides egcd(m,n) <=> d divides m /\ d divides n`;;
</PRE></DIV>
A natural way to proceed is by induction on the sum of the arguments:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(GEN_TAC THEN GEN_TAC THEN WF_INDUCT_TAC `m + n`);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

   0 [`!m'' n'.
             m'' + n' < m + n
             ==> (!d. d divides egcd (m'',n') <=> d divides m'' /\ d divides n')`]

  `!d. d divides egcd (m,n) <=> d divides m /\ d divides n`
</PRE></DIV>
Note that we have the same goal, but an assumption that it holds for
smaller values of the measure term.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Wellfounded induction can always be performed on any relation by using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>WF_IND</SPAN>
together with an assumption of wellfoundedness such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num_WF</SPAN> or
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>WF_MEASURE</SPAN>. This tactic is just a slightly more convenient packaging.
