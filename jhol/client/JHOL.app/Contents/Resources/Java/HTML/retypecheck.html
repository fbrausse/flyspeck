<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Typecheck a term, iterating over possible overload resolutions.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This is the main HOL Light typechecking function. Given an environment <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>env</SPAN> of
pretype assignments for variables, it assigns a pretype to all variables and
constants, including performing resolution of overloaded constants based on
what type information there is. Normally, this happens implicitly when a term
is entered in the quotation parser.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if some terms cannot be consistently assigned a type.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
Only users seeking to change HOL's parser and typechecker quite radically need
to use this function.
