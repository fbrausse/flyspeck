<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV : conv -&gt; conv</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Applies a conversion once to the first suitable sub-term(s) encountered in
top-down order.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV c tm</SPAN> applies the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> once to the first subterm or
subterms encountered in a top-down `parallel' search of the term <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN> for which
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> succeeds.  If the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> fails on all subterms of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>tm</SPAN>, the theorem
returned is <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>|- tm = tm</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
The following example shows how <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN> applies a conversion to only
the first suitable subterm(s) found in a top-down search:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ONCE_DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV `(\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- (\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2 = (\y. y + 2) 1
</PRE></DIV>
Here, there are two beta-redexes in the input term. One of these
occurs within the other, so <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>BETA_CONV</SPAN> is applied only to the outermost one.

Note that the supplied conversion is applied by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN> to all
independent subterms at which it succeeds.  That is, the conversion is applied
to every suitable subterm not contained in some other subterm for which the
conversions also succeeds, as illustrated by the following example:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # ONCE_DEPTH_CONV num_CONV `(\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2`;;
  val it : thm = |- (\x. (\y. y + x) 1) 2 = (\x. (\y. y + x) (SUC 0)) (SUC 1)
</PRE></DIV>
Here <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num_CONV</SPAN> is applied to both <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>2</SPAN>, since neither term
occurs within a larger subterm for which the conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>num_CONV</SPAN> succeeds.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN> is frequently used when there is only one subterm to which
the desired conversion applies. This can be much faster than using other
functions that attempt to apply a conversion to all subterms of a term (e.g.
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DEPTH_CONV</SPAN>).  If, for example, the current goal in a goal-directed proof
contains only one beta-redex, and one wishes to apply <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>BETA_CONV</SPAN> to it, then
the tactic
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   CONV_TAC (ONCE_DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)
</PRE></DIV>
may, depending on where the beta-redex occurs, be much faster than
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   CONV_TAC (TOP_DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)
</PRE></DIV>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV c</SPAN> may also be used when the supplied conversion <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> never
fails, in which case using a conversion such as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>DEPTH_CONV c</SPAN>, which
applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>c</SPAN> repeatedly would never terminate.
