<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Tries to ensure that a tactic is valid.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
For any tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, the application <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>VALID t</SPAN> gives a new tactic that does
exactly the same as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> except that it also checks validity of the tactic
and will fail if it is violated. Validity means that the subgoals produced by
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> can, if proved, be used by the justification function given by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN> to
construct a theorem corresponding to the original goal.

This check is performed by actually creating, using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_fthm</SPAN>, theorems
corresponding to the subgoals, and seeing if the result of applying the
justification function to them gives a theorem corresponding to the original
goal. If it does, then <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>VALID t</SPAN> simply applies <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>t</SPAN>, and if not it fails. In
principle, the extra dummy hypothesis used by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>mk_fthm</SPAN> (necessary to ensure
logical soundness) could interfere with the mechanism of the tactic, but this
never seems to happen.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>COMMENTS</SPAN><DD>
You can always force validity checking whenever it is applied by using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>VALID</SPAN>
on a tactic. But if the goal is initially proved by using the subgoal stack
this is probably not necessary since <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>VALID</SPAN> is already implicitly applied in
the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>e</SPAN> (expand) function.
