<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>preterm_of_term : term -&gt; preterm</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Converts a term into a preterm.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
HOL Light uses ``pretypes'' and ``preterms'' as intermediate structures for
parsing and typechecking, which are later converted to types and terms. A call
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>preterm_of_term `tm`</SPAN> converts in the other direction, from a normal HOL term
back to a preterm.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
User manipulation of preterms is not usually necessary, unless you seek to
radically change aspects of parsing and typechecking.
