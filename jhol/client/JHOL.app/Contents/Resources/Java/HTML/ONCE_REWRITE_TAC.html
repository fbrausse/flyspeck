<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC : thm list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a goal only once with <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>basic_rewrites</SPAN> and the supplied list
of theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
A set of equational rewrites is generated from the theorems supplied
by the user and the set of basic tautologies, and these are used to
rewrite the goal at all subterms at which a match is found in one pass
over the term part of the goal. The result is returned without
recursively applying the rewrite theorems to it. The order in which
the given theorems are applied is an implementation matter and the user
should not depend on any ordering. More details about rewriting can be
found under <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> does not fail and does not diverge. It results in
an invalid tactic if any of the applied rewrites introduces new
assumptions to the theorem eventually proved.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Given a theorem list:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let thl = map (num_CONV o mk_small_numeral) (1--3);;
  val thl : thm list = [|- 1 = SUC 0; |- 2 = SUC 1; |- 3 = SUC 2]
</PRE></DIV>
and the following goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `0 < 3`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `0 < 3`
</PRE></DIV>
the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl</SPAN> performs a single rewrite
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(ONCE_REWRITE_TAC thl);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `0 < SUC 2`
</PRE></DIV>
in contrast to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC thl</SPAN> which would rewrite the goal
repeatedly into this form:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e(REWRITE_TAC thl);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `0 < SUC (SUC (SUC 0))`
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> can be used iteratively to rewrite when recursive
rewriting would diverge.  It can also be used to save inference steps.
