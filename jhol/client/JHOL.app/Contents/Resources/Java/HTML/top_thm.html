<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Returns the theorem just proved using the subgoal package.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The function <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>top_thm</SPAN> is part of the subgoal package. A proof state of the
package consists of either  goal and justification stacks if a proof is in
progress or a theorem if a proof has just been completed. If the proof state
consists of a theorem, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>top_thm</SPAN> returns that theorem. For a description of the
subgoal package, see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>set_goal</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>top_thm</SPAN> will fail if the proof state does not hold a theorem. This will be
so either because no goal has been set or because a proof is in progress with
unproven subgoals.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Accessing the result of an interactive proof session with the subgoal package.
