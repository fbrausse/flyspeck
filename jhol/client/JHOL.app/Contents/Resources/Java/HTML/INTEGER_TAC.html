<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Automated tactic for elementary divisibility properties over the integers.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INTEGER_TAC</SPAN> is a partly heuristic tactic that can often
automatically prove elementary ``divisibility'' properties of the integers. The
precise subset that is dealt with is difficult to describe rigorously, but many
universally quantified combinations of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>divides</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>coprime</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>gcd</SPAN> and
congruences <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>(x == y) (mod n)</SPAN> can be proved automatically, as well as some
existentially quantified goals. See the documentation for <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>INTEGER_RULE</SPAN> for a
larger set of representative examples.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails if the goal is not accessible to the methods used.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
A typical elementary divisibility property is that if <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a * x</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a * y</SPAN> are
congruent modulo <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> and the two numbers <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>a</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>n</SPAN> are coprime (share no
common factor besides <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>1</SPAN>), then in fact <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>x</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>y</SPAN> are congruent:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # g `!a n x y:int. (a * x == a * y) (mod n) /\ coprime(a,n)
                     ==> (x == y) (mod n)`;;
  ...
</PRE></DIV>
It can be solved automatically using <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>NUMBER_TAC</SPAN>:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # e NUMBER_TAC;;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
</PRE></DIV>
