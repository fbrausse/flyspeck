<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
First-order proof search with specified search limits and increment.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
This is a slight generalization of the usual tactics for first-order proof
search. Normally <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_MESON_TAC</SPAN> explore the search
space by successively increasing a size limit from 0, increasing it by 1 per
step and giving up when a depth of 50 is reached. The more general tactic
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_MESON_TAC</SPAN> allows the user to specify the starting, finishing and stepping
value, but is otherwise identical to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_MESON_TAC</SPAN>. In fact, that is defined
as:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
  # let ASM_MESON_TAC = GEN_MESON_TAC 0 50 1;;
</PRE></DIV>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
If the goal is unprovable, <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_MESON_TAC</SPAN> will fail, though not necessarily in
a feasible amount of time.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Normally, the defaults built into <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>MESON_TAC</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ASM_MESON_TAC</SPAN> are
reasonably effective. However, very occasionally a goal exhibits a small search
space yet still requires a deep proof, so you may find <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_MESON_TAC</SPAN> with a
larger ``maximum'' value than 50 useful. Another potential use is to start the
search at a depth that you know will succeed, to reduce the search time when a
proof is re-run. However, the inconvenience of doing this is seldom repaid by a
dramatic improvement in performance, since exploration is normally at least
exponential with the size bound.
