<DIV class=TYPE><PRE>GEN_REWRITE_TAC : (conv -&gt; conv) -&gt; thm list -&gt; tactic</PRE></DIV>
<DL>

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Rewrites a goal, selecting terms according to a user-specified strategy.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
Distinct rewriting tactics differ in the search strategies used in finding
subterms on which to apply substitutions, and the built-in theorems used in
rewriting. In the case of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, this is a recursive traversal starting
from the body of the goal's conclusion part, while in the case of
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN>, for example, the search stops as soon as a term on which a
substitution is possible is found. <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> allows a user to specify a
more complex strategy for rewriting.

The basis of pattern-matching for rewriting is the notion of conversions,
through the application of <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>REWR_CONV</SPAN>.  Conversions are rules for mapping
terms with theorems equating the given terms to other semantically equivalent
ones.

When attempting to rewrite subterms recursively, the use of conversions (and
therefore rewrites) can be automated further by using functions which take a
conversion and search for instances at which they are applicable. Examples of
these functions are <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_DEPTH_CONV</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>RAND_CONV</SPAN>. The first argument to
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> is such a function, which specifies a search strategy; i.e.
it specifies how subterms (on which substitutions are allowed) should be
searched for.

The second and third arguments are lists of theorems used for rewriting. The
order in which these are used is not specified. The theorems need not be in
equational form: negated terms, say <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"~ t"</SPAN>, are transformed into the
equivalent equational form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"t = F"</SPAN>, while other non-equational theorems with
conclusion of form <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"t"</SPAN> are cast as the corresponding equations <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>"t = T"</SPAN>.
Conjunctions are separated into the individual components, which are used as
distinct rewrites.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
<SPAN CLASS=BRKT>GEN_REWRITE_TAC</SPAN> fails if the search strategy fails. It may also cause a
non-terminating sequence of rewrites, depending on the search strategy used.
The resulting tactic is invalid when a theorem which matches the goal (and
which is thus used for rewriting it with) has a hypothesis which is not
alpha-convertible to any of the assumptions of the goal. Applying such an
invalid tactic may result in a proof of a theorem which does not correspond to
the original goal.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>USES</SPAN><DD>
Detailed control of rewriting strategy, allowing a user to specify a search
strategy.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>EXAMPLE</SPAN><DD>
Given a goal such as:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   ?- a - (b + c) = a - (c + b)
</PRE></DIV>
we may want to rewrite only one side of it with a theorem,
say <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ADD_SYM</SPAN>. Rewriting tactics which operate recursively result in
divergence; the tactic <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ONCE_REWRITE_TAC [ADD_SYM]</SPAN> rewrites on both
sides to produce the following goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   ?- a - (c + b) = a - (b + c)
</PRE></DIV>
as <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ADD_SYM</SPAN> matches at two positions. To rewrite on
only one side of the equation, the following tactic can be used:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   GEN_REWRITE_TAC (RAND_CONV o ONCE_DEPTH_CONV) [ADD_SYM]
</PRE></DIV>
which produces the desired goal:
<DIV class=XMPL><PRE>
   ?- a - (c + b) = a - (c + b)
</PRE></DIV>
