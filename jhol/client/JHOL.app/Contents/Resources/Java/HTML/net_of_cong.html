<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Add a congruence rule to a net.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The underlying machinery in rewriting and simplification assembles
(conditional) rewrite rules and other conversions into a net, including a
priority number so that, for example, pure rewrites get applied before
conditional rewrites. The congruence rules used by the simplifier to establish
context (see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>extend_basic_congs</SPAN>) are also stored in this structure, with the
lowest priority 4. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net_of_cong th net</SPAN> adds <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th</SPAN> as a new congruence
rule to <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>net</SPAN> to yield an updated net.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Fails unless the congruence is of the appropriate implicational form.
