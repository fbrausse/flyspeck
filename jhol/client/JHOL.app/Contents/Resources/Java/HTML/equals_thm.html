<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Equality test on theorems.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
The call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>equals_thm th1 th2</SPAN> returns <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>true</SPAN> if and only if both the
conclusions and assumptions of the two theorems <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th1</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>th2</SPAN> are exactly the
same. The same can be achieved by a simple equality test, but it is better
practice to use this function because it will also work in the proof recording
version of HOL Light (see the <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>Proofrecording</SPAN> subdirectory).

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails.
