<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>SYNOPSIS</SPAN><DD>
Add congruence rules to a simpset.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>DESCRIPTION</SPAN><DD>
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked
by <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>SIMP_TAC</SPAN>) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process
theorems into rewrites. A call <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ss_of_congs thl ss</SPAN> adds <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>thl</SPAN> as new
congruence rules to the simpset <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>ss</SPAN> to yield a new simpset. For an
illustration of how congruence rules can be used, see <SPAN CLASS=BRKT>extend_basic_congs</SPAN>.

<P><DT><SPAN CLASS=FIELD-NAME>FAILURE CONDITIONS</SPAN><DD>
Never fails unless the congruence rules are malformed.
