(* port of univariate.cc
   a univariate represents a function u:real->real.
   its first derivative du:real->real
   and its second derivative ddu;real->real.

   For example, if the function is x |-> x,
   its derivative is x |-> 1,
   and second derivative is x |-> 0,
   which is implemented as ux1.

   We give a few other examples, sqrt,  1/x, atan.
