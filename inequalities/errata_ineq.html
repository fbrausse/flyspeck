<h3>Errata for the code used in the proof of the Kepler conjecture.</h3>
<UL>
<li>
file: definitions_kepler.ml,
 <p>definition: delta_x,</p>
 <p>here is the correct definition:
 <pre>let delta_x = kepler_def (`delta_x x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 =
x1*x4*(--x1 + x2 + x3 -x4 + x5 + x6) +
x2*x5*(x1 - x2 + x3 + x4 -x5 + x6) +
x3*x6*(x1 + x2 - x3 + x4 + x5 - x6)
-x2*x3*x4 - x1*x3*x5 - x1*x2*x6 -x4*x5*x6`);;</pre></p>
  <p>source corrected Nov 22, 2004</p>
 <p>thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Sep 21, 2004</P></li>

<li>file: definitions_kepler.ml,
    <p>definition: beta,</p>
    <p>replace (cos pi) with (cos psi),</p>
    <p>thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Nov 18, 2004</p>
    <p>source corrected Nov 22, 2004</p></li>

<li>file: definitions_kepler.ml,
   <p>definition: zeta,</p>
   <p>replace 
   <pre>(&amp;1)/(atn ((&amp;2)/(&amp;5)))</pre> with 
   <pre>(&amp;1)/((&amp;2) * atn (sqrt2/(&amp;5)))</pre></p>

   <p>note: the correct value of zeta has the property that 
     4*pi*zeta is approximately 22.79, the constant that appears in
     the problem of 13 spheres (a triangulation of the sphere 
     with fewer than 23
     triangles has at most 13 vertices)</p></li>
    <p>source corrected Nov 22, 2004</p>
   <p>thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Nov 18, 2004</p>

<li>file: definitions_kepler.ml,
   <p>definition: gamma_x,</p>
   <p>replace second term involving dihx with
   <pre>dihx x2 x3 x1 x5 x6 x4</pre></p>
   <p>The earlier incorrect version had a repeated x2 instead of x4.</p>
   <p>Source corrected Feb 21, 2005</p>
   <p>Thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Feb 17, 2005</p>

<li>file: kep_inequalities.ml,
   <p>inequality: J_241241504_1</p>
   <p>This inequality was added.  It will be used in DCG-2005 version in Lemma 10.7.</P>
   <p>Source changed March 10, 2005</p>
   <p>Thanks to J. Lagarias for the suggestion.</p>

<li>file: kep_inequalities.ml,
   <p>inequality: I_529738375_5</p>
   <p>This inequality was corrected.</p>
   <p>Source changed July 20, 2005</p>
   <p>Thanks to Roland Zumkeller - Flyspeck google group posting on Jun 1, 1:12 pm.</p>


<li>file: definitions_kepler,
     <p>definition: vorstar</p>
     <p>phi0 is defined as `phi t0 t0`, but is used in the definition
of vorstar where the truncation is parameterized.</p>
     <p>Source changed September 12, 2007</p>
     <p>Thanks to Sean McLaughlin for spotting the bug.</p>
