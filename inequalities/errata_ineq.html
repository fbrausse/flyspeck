<h3>Errata for the code used in the proof of the Kepler conjecture.</h3>

There is one known issue in the code that has not been corrected.
In the file kep_inequalities.ml, there is an implicit assumption
that (delta => 0) in the inequalities that involve that function.
For the specification to be correct, this assumption needs to
be made explicit in every case where the domain contains points
with (delta < 0).  This assumption was added on a case-by-case
basis in the 1998 verification of the inequalities.  This
issue potentially affects a large number of inequalities.
Thanks to Sean McLaughlin for pointing out this bug.

<li>
file: definitions_kepler.ml,
 <p>definition: delta_x,</p>
 <p>here is the correct definition:
 <pre>let delta_x = kepler_def (`delta_x x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 =
x1*x4*(--x1 + x2 + x3 -x4 + x5 + x6) +
x2*x5*(x1 - x2 + x3 + x4 -x5 + x6) +
x3*x6*(x1 + x2 - x3 + x4 + x5 - x6)
-x2*x3*x4 - x1*x3*x5 - x1*x2*x6 -x4*x5*x6`);;</pre></p>
  <p>source corrected Nov 22, 2004</p>
 <p>thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Sep 21, 2004</P></li>

<li>file: definitions_kepler.ml,
    <p>definition: beta,</p>
    <p>replace (cos pi) with (cos psi),</p>
    <p>thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Nov 18, 2004</p>
    <p>source corrected Nov 22, 2004</p></li>

<li>file: definitions_kepler.ml,
   <p>definition: zeta,</p>
   <p>replace 
   <pre>(&amp;1)/(atn ((&amp;2)/(&amp;5)))</pre> with 
   <pre>(&amp;1)/((&amp;2) * atn (sqrt2/(&amp;5)))</pre></p>

   <p>note: the correct value of zeta has the property that 
     4*pi*zeta is approximately 22.79, the constant that appears in
     the problem of 13 spheres (a triangulation of the sphere 
     with fewer than 23
     triangles has at most 13 vertices)</p></li>

<li>file: definitions_kepler.ml,
   <p>definition: gamma_x,</p>
   <p>replace second term involving dihx with
   <pre>dihx x2 x3 x1 x5 x6 x4</pre></p>
   <p>The earlier incorrect version had a repeated x2 instead of x4.</p>
   <p>Source corrected Feb 21, 2005</p>
   <p>Thanks to Roland Zumkeller, Feb 17, 2005</p>

<li>file: kep_inequalities.ml,
   <p>inequality: J_241241504_1</p>
   <p>This inequality was added.  It will be used in DCG-2005 version in Lemma 10.7.</P>
   <p>Source changed March 10, 2005</p>
   <p>Thanks to J. Lagarias for the suggestion.</p>

<li>file: kep_inequalities.ml,
   <p>inequality: I_529738375_5</p>
   <p>This inequality was corrected.</p>
   <p>Source changed July 20, 2005</p>
   <p>Thanks to Roland Zumkeller - Flyspeck google group posting on Jun 1, 1:12 pm.</p>


<li>file: definitions_kepler,
     <p>definition: vorstar</p>
     <p>phi0 is defined as `phi t0 t0`, but is used in the definition
of vorstar where the truncation is parameterized.</p>
     <p>Source changed September 12, 2007</p>
     <p>Thanks to Sean McLaughlin for spotting the bug.</p>


<li>file: definitions_kepler,
     <p>definition: tau_sigma_x</p>
     <p>The sigma_qrtet_x in the definition should be
      sigma1_qrtet_x</p>
     <p>Source changed Sept 12, 2007</p>

<li>file: kep_inequalities.ml,
     <p>inequality 636208429, which is a group of seven:
     [ J_550901847;J_559163627;J_571492944;J_471806843;J_610154063;
   J_466112442;J_904445624];
     <p>inequality 599117591
     <p>inequality 572068135
     <p>In all these inequalities the function tau_analytic_x should
     be replaced with tau_sigma_x</p>
     <p>The problem goes back to 2003 when the kep_inequalities.ml
     file was automatically converted from one format to another.
     It does not affect the published proof.
     <p>Thanks to Sean McLaughlin for spotting a false inequality.
     <p>Source corrected September 12, 2007</p>

<li>file:definitions_kepler.ml
   <p>definition: atn2</p>
   <p>A new function atn2(x,y) has been introduced, which
   equals atn(x/y) when y!=0.  
   Several functions such as dihedral_x have been rewritten with atn2
   rather than atn.
   <p>Thanks to Sean McLaughlin.
