  It is difficult to search for the theorem HAS_COMPLEX_DERIVATIVE_AT_WITHIN
 relating (at x) to (at x within s).
  Any search I could think of matches all (at x within s) patterns.

Failure "No goal set".
No goal set error generated in prove_by_refinement if there are excess tactics in the list after the goal is completed.

Idea: binary operators for float.hl.  Make theorems into
tokens that are processed by a parser.  Adding tokens adds the
corresponding floats.

There should be a division of rewrites and matches into clases.
Terminators: set tac, vector arith tac, complex arith tac, real arith, bool arith.
Definitional rewrites.
Propositional rewrites
Predicate rewrites
Factoids (small things like x IN {y}).
Strategies.  Big changes in direction of the goal.

Ideas for productivity
      Add to suggest() function
      Search suite, entire collection of search related functions.
      Stepping through proofs.
      Emacs hol-light mode bindings.  These could be made more intuitive.

    search history as reference.

    (On second thought, I think the spec really did change, so the problem is
    with Flyspeck, not with Hol Light.)
    new_specification make it benign when it is so.
    I cannot currently reload a file that contains a specification.
    (Quick fix. Redefine new_spec so that it does not try to redo a spec.)

    Force-match is like unix diff command (but for trees)
    We want a longest common subsequence.

   Force match is also like sequence alignment in molecular biology

    Idea: add a version manager, that allows running of older svn versions
    at the individual file level, so that I can run an old version of hypermap.hl
    with the new version of everything else.

    Idea: if a constant has already been declared, do an automatic renaming
    constant ->  constant.1 constant.2
    and carry forward from there with special parsing that shadows the old constant.
    original constant prints as constant.0

    Stateless HOL:
    Definitions are currently of the form "newterm = rhs"
    Instead have a term constructor Constant of term that takes the right-hand side.
    Or better yet, have just three built-in constants "=", "@", "constant:A->A"
    The first two are undefined, the third is defined as "constant:A->A = (\x. x)"

    The parser and printer look at "constant" for special printing and
    parsing, fixity, etc.  For example, `constant (\ x Y. Y x)` can be
    given infix status and called "IN" during printing.  The theorem
    `constant (\x Y. Y x) x Y = Y x` can be printed as `x IN Y <=> Y
    x`.

    Generalize interval arithmetic
    interval x d e allows x to be any valid user input, and (d,e) give the special representation that can be automatically manipulated.

    Allow other algorithms to work with REP x d objects which assert that user input x is represented by algorithmic object d.

    Catalyst idea again.
    A goal can be given a "catalyst marker" that increases the relevance in relevance
    filtering.

    Work on relevance filtering from the point of view of forced matching.

Sun Jul 25 08:23:14 ICT 2010 I have a question about Phil's
    prsentation.  Exactly what are the decision points in Simulink and
    what does the user control who is matching things up?

    In float.hl, I was catching all exceptions in the INTERVAL_OF_TERM.
    It was also catching the Break exception thrown by C-cC-c Interrupt,
    making the function uninterruptable.

    In Mathematica, I had written an external file numerical.m that contained
    a Mathematica symbol "<=" (as a single character).  When I cut and pasted
    the code it worked fine.  When I read the entire file in, the character created
    a bug.

    Create full error messages with $MessagePrePrint = StandardForm;

    I created an alias in my laptop .bashrc for math to start
    Mathematica in the shell.  For example math -run
    "Print[N[Dihedral[2,2,2,2,2,2]]]; Quit[]"

    I am running Mathematica now from Sys.command within HOL-Light in emacs.
    If I accidently interrupt while Mathematica is running, I get the
    Interrupt> prompt in Mathematica.
    To quit, go to the prompt, type "quit" then emacs: M-x comint-send-input

    I installed a printer with a bug, so that terms would no longer print.
    I reloaded the old version, but this shadowed the name of the installed printer,
    so that I could no longer name it to uninstall it.  I had to kill the process.
    Moral: save the identifier of any printer that you install, so you can remove it.

    List.assoc raises Not_found
    lib.ml assoc raises Failure _
    So it matters in the code which version is used.
    After opening List and reloading a module, the code no longer functioned,
    because it was only catching Failure _ exceptions!

    We should wrap basic hol light files in modules.
