Melhorn:
	Cgal exact, complete, efficient.
	Intersection of curves
	Intersection of quadrics.
	Primitive: intersection of two algebraic curves.
	Descartes's  rule of sign.  (For (c,d) transform to (0,infty))
	Algorithm computes an isolating interval from Descartes.
	Once isolating interval is known, we apply Newton, etc.
	Landau converse to Descartes: If there is no complex root
	in the disk at $(c+d)/2$, then Descartes's variation is $0$.
	Landau gives convergence.
	Sign variation is subadditive over intervals.

	?? What about where exact analysis is needed: $p(0)=0$,
	multiple roots, positive or nonnegative,
