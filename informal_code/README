  Code used for the informal computer programs used in the proof of the Kepler conjecture.
  These files are not required for the flyspeck project.


  cfsqp subdirectory: software that uses gradient descent optimization
  to test nonlinear inequalities.  Because of licensing issues, some
  of the source code is not available in this code repository.

  graph_generator subdirectory: java software for classification of
  tame hypermaps.  It was later formalized in Isabelle.

  interval_code subdirectory: C++ software to use interval arithmetic
  to verify nonlinear inequalities. It was later formalized by code in
  the formal_ineqs directory.

  mathematica subdirectory: Mathematica code that was used in making
  many calculations leading to the original proof of the Kepler
  conjecture and the revised version in "Dense Sphere Packings"

  port_interval: A translation of the C++ code in interval_code to
  Objective CAML.  This is the starting point for the formal code in
  the formal_ineqs directory.

  check_completeness.hl: Objective Caml code that was used to check
  that no cases were overlooked in the Main Estimate.  This was later
  formalized.
