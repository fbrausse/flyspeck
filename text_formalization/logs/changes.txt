  Global rename `voronoi` -> `voronoi_open`.
  Deleted a needless conjunct from `voronoi_le`
  Merged TARJJUW's def of packing with Sphere.packing
  Yesterday, SET_TAC -> ASM_SET_TAC as needed for new release of hol light.
  rename `saturate` -> `saturated`.
  rename `voronoi_le` -> `voronoi_closed`, and reversed the argument order.

    New in svn 1557.
    replaced negligible_fun with negligible_fun_p to make the dependence on p explicit.
    Rewrote JGXZYGW to use negligible_fun_p instead of negligible_fun

    pack_defs.hl, definition of `marchal` corrected, sqrt(&2) inserted,
    (thanks to Vu Khac Ky)

    fan.hl broken into fan.hl, topology.hl, planarity.hl (renaming earlier fan_definitions.hl, etc.)
    modules renamed so that they don't all have the same identifier "Fan".  Fan in fan.hl, Topology in topology.hl,
    file fan_defs.hl added.
    yfan replaced with yfan_deprecated.  A new yfan definition has been added correcting an error in yfan_deprecated.
    There are three versions of  inverse_sigma_fan.  They have been renamed so that they have different names.
    fan.hl:inverse_sigma_fan renamed as inverse_sigma_fan_alt
    fan_misc.hl:inverse_sigma_fan renamed as inverse_sigma_fan_bis

  changed the definition of sol so that it does not require C to be measurable.  The order of the arguments was also reversed.  Now it is  sol x C

    The definition of mcell0,...,mcell4 slightly changes in a way that affects degenerate
    cases. (Thanks to Ky)

    new hypermap file
    renames lemma_card_inverse_map_eq to lemma_orbit_inverse_map
    gives a new definition of mAdd.

    Definition of weakly_saturated was corrected so that it agrees with
    flypaper.  This temporarily breaks the proof of TARJJUW.

    Some global changes in Linear programming constants have been made.
    This affects head.mod.
    TameTableD[6,0] decreased to 0.712.
    
Mon Jan 16 17:14:37 EST 2012
    TameTableD[6,0] changed to 0.712 in flypaper and text_formalization files.
    Simplified the definition of dihX.

    various definitions have been modified to equivalent forms:
    radial_norm is now defined as radial,
    eventually_radial_norm is defined as eventually_radial,
    sol is defined in terms of radial and ball, not radial_norm and normball,
    map0 definition has been removed, and replaced with cube.
    hinhcau x r is now defined as ball(x,r).

    beta_bump has been replaced with the much simpler beta_bump_v1.

    Made a mass deletion of theorems that are not used.
    Svn 3676 is the old version with the theorems.
