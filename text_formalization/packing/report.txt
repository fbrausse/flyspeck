(* =========================================================================== *)

What I did with these 6 files I sent you:

1. In the file LEPJBDJ.hl
- I added a lemma call LEPJBDJ_0 that claims the intersection of V and mcell0 
  is {}.
- Corrected the name of the header from RVFXZBU to LEPJBDJ

2. In the file pack_defs.hl
- I corrected the definition of VX. With this definition, everything works fine.
- I removed the lemma VX_alt, because it is no longer true.

3. In the file pack_concl.hl
- I added 2 two statements LEPJBDJ_concl and LEPJBDJ_0_concl, so that it is   
  convenient if some one want to search for it. 
- I added the statement HDTFNFZ_conc of lemma HDTFNFZ because it was not there.
  (Please notice that I added the assumption that the mcell is negligible).
- I added the assumption that the mcell is negligible to URRPHBZ3_concl.
  This makes the proof much easier (in fact I don't know whether the lemma is 
  true without this condition). When working further, it is still easy to use 
  this changed lemma. 

4. The file URRPHBZ2.hl is created. 

5. The file HDTFNFZ.hl is created. 
   In order to use this lemma, it is necessary to re-load the file pack_defs.hl
   because the lemma uses the new definition of VX.

6. The file URRPHBZ3.hl is created.
   In order to use this lemma, it is necessary to re-load the file pack_defs.hl
   and the file pack_concl.hl because the statement of the lemma is changed and 
   it uses the new definition of VX.
