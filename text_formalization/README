The text_formalization/ directory contains Hol-light files for the formalization of
the text part of the Flyspeck project. It is structured along the lines of the .tex document "flypaper.tex" (Sphere Packings - a blueprint for formal proofs)

The subdirectory structure is as follows (in logical order)

The Multivariate/flyspeck.ml file is needed before any of the files in these directories.

X- general/  general definitions and tactics
X- nonlinear/  a list of nonlinear inequalities that are used in the text part of the proof
X- leg/  lemmas in elementary geometry

Then the individual chapters follow.
1- trigonometry/  
2- volume/
3- hypermap/
4- fan/
5- packing/
6- local/
7- tame/ 

The files build.hl and strictbuild.hl go through the build sequence.
(The file strictbuild.hl goes through the build much more cautiously with greater
 error reporting.  The file build.hl does the ordinary everyday build.)
