The text_formalization/ directory contains Hol-light files for the formalization of
the text part of the Flyspeck project. It is structured along the lines of the .tex document "flypaper.tex" (Sphere Packings - a blueprint for formal proofs)

The subdirectory structure is as follows (in logical order)

X- general/  general definitions and tactics
X- nonlinear/  a list of nonlinear inequalities that are used in the proof

Then the individual chapters follow.
1- trigonometry/  
2- volume/
3- hypermap/
4- fan/
5- packing/
6- cyclic/
7- tame/ 

The Multivariate/flyspeck.ml file is needed before any of the files in these directories.
