John Harrison's material on polyhedra:

AJXXAWK
Definition 4.5:   IS_AFFINE_HULL
                   affine / hull
                   aff_dim
                   AFF_DIM_EMPTY

EDANAOL
 Definition 4.6 :  IN_INTERIOR
                   IN_RELATIVE_INTERIOR
                   CLOSURE_APPROACHABLE
                   (Don't have definition of relative boundary, but
                    several theorems use closure s DIFF relative_interior s.)

QLITJET
 Definition 4.7:   face_of
                   extreme_point_of (presumably it's meant to be the point not
                   the singleton set, which the definition literally gives)
                   facet_of
                   edge_of
                   (Don't have a definition of "proper"; I just use
                    ~(f = {}) and/or ~(f = P) as needed.)

MUGGQUF
 Lemma 4.18:       KREIN_MILMAN_MINKOWSKI

QSRHLXB
 Definition 4.8:   polyhedron
                   vertices

LTHQIAA
 Lemma 4.19:       AFFINE_IMP_POLYHEDRON

CZZHBLI
 Lemma 4.20 (i):   FACET_OF_POLYHEDRON_EXPLICIT

 Lemma 4.20 (ii):  Direct consequence of RELATIVE_INTERIOR_POLYHEDRON

 Lemma 4.20 (iii): FACE_OF_POLYHEDRON_EXPLICIT / FACE_OF_POLYHEDRON

 Lemma 4.20 (iv):  FACE_OF_TRANS

 Lemma 4.20 (v):   EXTREME_POINT_OF_FACE

 Lemma 4.20 (vi):  FACE_OF_EQ

QOEPBJD
 Corr. 4.7:        FACE_OF_POLYHEDRON_POLYHEDRON

NEHRQPR:
 Lemma 4.21:       POLYHEDRON_COLLINEAR_FACES

ZMQQFUP:
 Def 4.9:          vertices
                   edges

If you like, I can go ahead and prove the last few theorems at the
end of the chapter, relating polyhedra and fans.


(NOTE: I think John Harrison did the theorems relating polyhedra
and fans, but I cannot find them -thales)
