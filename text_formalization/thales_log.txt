**Tue Nov 11 09:32:31 EST 2008 Code inspection:

Operating system Mac OS X 10.4.11
Objective Caml version 3.09.3
hol_version "2.20++"
Flyspeck version 676, Nov 11.
I load the files with build.ml
Reload as needed with loadt "filename.ml";;

* Errors encountered:
First error encountered in hull.ml.  I moved incorrect lemmas to hull_error.ml.
Next error in collect_geom.ml.  Errors moved to collect_geom_error.ml
Errors with phi,A in volume.ml (already defined).  Also, volume.ml needs to convert proofs from the "g-e" interactive format to the format packaged with "prove".
fan.ml has a parse error caused by a string of *****.  fan.ml should not use the name X (see general issues below).  I replaced X,Y with xfan, yfan instead, because otherwise geomdetail.ml cannot load.
assembly.ml has definition of anchor that conflicts with geomdetail.ml.  Renamed to anchor_alt.

* Some files are using common symbols such as X for definitions.
Remember that there can be only one X defined in the entire proof of the Kepler conjecture!  If you take "X" for yourself, then nobody else can ever use it again!!  Please choose names that don't hog resources.  

* assembly.ml and geomdetail.ml are using Multivariate/convex.ml.  convex.ml is not compatible with the previously loaded files.  I believe that J. Harrison plans to make it compatible.  Until then, it cannot be used.  I have commented them out.
