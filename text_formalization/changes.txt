    fan.hl broken into introduction.hl, topology.hl, planarity.hl (renaming earlier fan_definitions.hl, etc.)
    modules renamed so that they don't all have the same identifier "Fan".  Fan in introduction.hl, Topology in topology.hl,
    file fan_defs.hl added.
    yfan replaced with yfan_deprecated.  A new yfan definition has been added correcting an error in yfan_deprecated.
    There are three versions of  inverse_sigma_fan.  They have been renamed so that they have different names.
    introduction.hl:inverse_sigma_fan renamed as inverse_sigma_fan_alt
    fan_misc.hl:inverse_sigma_fan renamed as inverse_sigma_fan_bis
