PPHEUFG: tame_opposite.hl - completely proved

RUNOQPQ: TameGeneral.hl - completely proved

UBHDEUU: TameGeneral.hl - completely proved

CKQOWSA: CKQOWSA.hl - completely proved

FATUGPD: FATUGPD.hl - completely proved (UBHDEUU as an assumption can be removed)

FNJLBXS: ?

FCDJDOT: ?

HRXEFDM: HRXEFDM.hl - two assumptions: 
                      1) the sum of solid angles is 4 * pi;
					  2) contravening(V) => conforming (V,ESTD V).

JGTDEBU (10 theorems): TameGeneral.hl 
    completely proved: 2 (plain), 5 (is_edge_nondegenerate), 6 (no_loops), 
	                   7 (is_no_double_joints), 10 (tame_10), 11a (tame_11a)
	partially proved: 8 (number_of_faces >= 3, assumption: simple_hypermap)
	unproven: 1 (planar_hypermap), 3 (connected_hypermap), 4 (simple_hypermap)
	
CDTETAT: development/CDTETAT.hl - proved under assumptions:
       1) contravening V ==> simple_hypermap (hypermap_of_fan (V,ESTD V)) (this is JGTDEBU4)
	   2) for every dart x in a nontriangular face the inequality 1.15 <= azim(x) holds
	   3) several nonlinear inequalities
	   
SZIPOAS: development/CDTETAT.hl - proved under the same assumptions as CDTETAT

KCBLRQC: development/KCBLRQC.hl - some preliminary results are proved.
                                  The proof of this lemma should be not difficult: linear programs
								  can be proved using tools in formal_lp/arith

BDJYFFB: development/KCBLRQC.hl - BDJYFFB2 is proved under assumptions 
                                 (CDTETAT assumptions + nonlinear inequalities)
								 
CRTTXAT: CRTTXAT.hl - almost completely proved (JGTDEBU4 is assumed)
