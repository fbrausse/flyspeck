This paper is the third in a series of six papers devoted to the
proof of the Kepler conjecture, which asserts that no packing of
congruent balls in three dimensions has density greater than the
face-centered cubic packing.  In the previous paper in this series,
a continuous function $f$ on a compact space is defined, certain
points in the domain are conjectured to give the global maxima, and
the relation between this conjecture and the Kepler conjecture is
established. This paper shows that those points are indeed local
maxima. Various approximations to $f$ are developed, that will be
used in subsequent papers to bound the value of the function $f$.
The function $f$ can be expressed as a sum of terms, indexed by
regions on a unit sphere. Detailed estimates of the terms
corresponding to triangular and quadrilateral regions are developed.
