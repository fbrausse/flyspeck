This paper is the first in a series of six papers devoted to the
proof of the Kepler conjecture, which asserts that no packing of
congruent balls in three dimensions has density greater than the
face-centered cubic packing.   After some preliminary comments about
the face-centered cubic and hexagonal close packings, the history of
the Kepler problem is described, including a discussion of various
published bounds on the density of sphere packings.  There is also a
general historical discussion of various proof strategies that have
been tried with this problem.
