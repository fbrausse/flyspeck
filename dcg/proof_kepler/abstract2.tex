This paper is the second in a series of six papers devoted to the
proof of the Kepler conjecture, which asserts that no packing of
congruent balls in three dimensions has density greater than the
face-centered cubic packing.   The top level structure of the proof
is described. A compact topological space is described. Each point
of this space can be described as a finite cluster of balls with
additional combinatorial markings.  A continuous function on this
compact space is defined.  It is proved that the Kepler conjecture
will follow if the value of this function is never greater than a
given explicit constant.
