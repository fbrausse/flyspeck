This paper is the fourth in a series of six papers devoted to the
proof of the Kepler conjecture, which asserts that no packing of
congruent balls in three dimensions has density greater than the
face-centered cubic packing. In a previous paper in this series, a
continuous function $f$ on a compact space is defined, certain
points in the domain are conjectured to give the global maxima, and
the relation between this conjecture and the Kepler conjecture is
established. The function $f$ can be expressed as a sum of terms,
indexed by regions on a unit sphere.  In this paper, detailed
estimates of the terms corresponding general regions are developed.
These results form the technical heart of the proof of the Kepler
conjecture, by giving detailed bounds on the function $f$.  The
results rely on long computer calculations.
