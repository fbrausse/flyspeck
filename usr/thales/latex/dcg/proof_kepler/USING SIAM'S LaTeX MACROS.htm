<H2>Using SIAM's LaTeX Macros</H2><QUOTE><FONT size=-1><B>Abstract. 
</B>Documentation is given for use of the SIAM LaTeX macros. These macros are 
now compatible with LaTeX2e Instructions and suggestions for compliance with 
SIAM style standards are also included. </FONT></QUOTE>
<H3>1. Introduction</H3>This file is documentation for the SIAM LaTeX macros, 
and provides instruction for submission of your files.
<P>To accommodate authors who electronically typeset their manuscripts, SIAM 
supports the use of LaTeX. To ensure quality typesetting according to SIAM style 
standards, SIAM provides a LaTeX macro style file. Using LaTeX to format a 
manuscript should simplify the editorial processand lessen the author's 
proofreading burden. However,it is still necessary to proofread the galley 
proofs with care.
<P>Electronic files should not be submitted until the paper has been accepted, 
and then not until requested to do so by someone in the SIAMoffice. Once an 
article is slated for an issue, someone from the SIAM office will contact the 
author about any or all of the following: editorial and stylistic queries, 
supplying the source files (and any supplementary macros) for the properly 
formatted article, and handling figures.
<P>When submitting electronic files (electronic submissions) (to 
<B><CODE>tex@siam.org</B></CODE>) include the journal, issue, and author's name 
in the subject line of the message. Authors are responsible for ensuring that 
the paper generated from the source files exactly matches the paper that was 
accepted for publication by the review editor. If it does not, information on 
how it differs should be indicated in the transmission of the file. When 
submitting a file, please be sure to include any additional macros (other than 
those provided by SIAM) that will be needed to run the paper. 
<P>SIAM uses MS-DOS-based computers for LaTeX processing. Therefore all 
filenames should be restricted to eight characters or less, plus a three 
character extension.
<P>Once the files are corrected here at SIAM, we will mail the revised proofs to 
be read against the original edited hard copy manuscript. We are not set up to 
shuttle back and forth varying electronic versions of each paper, so we must 
rely on hard copy of the galleys. The author's proofreading is an important but 
easily overlooked step. Even if SIAM were not to introduce a single editorial 
change into your manuscript, there would still be a need to check, because 
electronic transmission can introduce errors.
<P>The distribution contains the following items: 
<B><CODE>siamltex.cls</B></CODE>, the main macro package based on 
<B><CODE>article.cls</B></CODE>; <B><CODE>siam10.clo</B></CODE>, for the 
ten-point size option; <B><CODE>subeqn.clo</B></CODE>, a style option for 
equation numbering (see <A 
href="http://www.siam.org/tex/journals/docutex.htm#S3">Section 3</A> for an 
explanation); and <B><CODE>siam.bst</CODE></B>, the style file for use with 
BibTeX. Also included are this file, <B><CODE>docultex.tex </B></CODE>and a 
sample file <B><CODE>lexample.tex</B></CODE>. The sample file represents a 
standard application of the macros. The rest of this paper will highlight some 
keys to effective macro use, as well as point out options and special cases, and 
describe SIAM style standards to which authors should conform.
<P>
<H3>2. Headings</H3>The top matter of a journal paper falls into a standard 
format. It begins of course with the <B><CODE>\documentclass</B></CODE> command
<P><B><PRE>\documentclass{siamltex}
</PRE></B>Other class options can be included in the bracketed argument of the 
command, separated by commas.
<P>Optional arguments include: 
<DL>
  <DT><B><CODE>[final]</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Without this option, lines which extend past the margin will have black 
  boxes next to them to help authors identify lines that they need to fix, by 
  re-writing or inserting breaks. <B><CODE>final</CODE></B> turns these boxes 
  off, so that very small margin breaks which are not noticible will not cause 
  boxes to be generated. 
  <DT><B><CODE>[oneeqnum]</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Normally <B><CODE>siamltex.cls</CODE></B> numbers equations, tables, 
  figures, and theorem environments with a decimal number, composed of the 
  section of the paper, a period, and the number of the enumerated object 
  (example: 1.2). The sequence of numbering is also restarted with each new 
  section, so that, for example, the last equation of section 3 may be 3.10, but 
  the first equation of section 4 would be 4.1. Using 
  <B><CODE>oneeqnum</CODE></B> numbers all equations consecutively throughout a 
  paper with a single digit. 
  <DT><B><CODE>[onethmnum]</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Using <B><CODE>onethmnum</CODE></B> numbers all theorem-like environments 
  consecutively throughout a paper with a single digit. 
  <DT><B><CODE>[onefignum]</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Using <B><CODE>onethmnum</CODE></B> numbers all figures consecutively 
  throughout a paper with a single digit. 
  <DT><B><CODE>[onetabnum]</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Using <B><CODE>onethmnum</CODE></B> numbers all tables consecutively 
  throughout a paper with a single digit. </DD></DL>The title and author parts are 
formatted using the <B><CODE>\title </B></CODE>and <B><CODE>\author 
</B></CODE>commands as described in Lamport <A 
href="http://www.siam.org/tex/journals/docutex.htm#note2">[2]</A>. The 
<B><CODE>\date </B></CODE>command is not used. <B><CODE>\maketitle 
</B></CODE>produces the actual output of the commands.
<P>The addresses and support acknowledgments are put into the <B><CODE>\author 
</B></CODE>commands via <B><CODE>\thanks</B></CODE>. If support is overall for 
the authors, the support acknowledgment should be put in a <B><CODE>\thanks 
</B></CODE>command in the <B><CODE>\title</B></CODE>. Specific support should go 
following the addresses of the individual authors in the same <B><CODE>\thanks 
</B></CODE>command.
<P>Sometimes authors have support or addresses in common which necessitates 
having multiple <B><CODE>\thanks </B></CODE>commands for each author. 
Unfortunately LaTeX does not normally allow this, so a special procedure must be 
used. An example of this procedure follows. Grant information can also be run 
into both authors' footnotes.

</PRE></B>Notice that the footnote marks begin with <B><CODE>[2] 
</B></CODE>because the first mark (the asterisk) will be used in the title for 
date-received information by SIAM, even if not already used for support data. 
This is just one example; other situations follow a similar pattern. Following 
the author and title is the abstract, key words listing, and AMS subject 
classification number(s), designated using the <B><CODE>{abstract}</CODE></B>, 
<B><CODE>{keywords}</B></CODE>, and <B><CODE>{AMS} </B></CODE>environments. If 
there is only one AMS number, the commands <B><CODE>\begin{AM} </B></CODE>and 
<B><CODE>\end{AM} </B></CODE>are used instead of <B><CODE>{AMS}</B></CODE>. This 
causes the heading to be in the singular. Authors are responsible for providing 
AMS numbers. They can be found in the Annual Index of Math Reviews, or through 
<A href="http://www.ams.org/mathweb/mi-classifications.html">the AMS web 
page</A>.
<P>Left and right running heads should be provided in thefollowing way.

</PRE></B><A name=S3>
<H3>3. Equations and mathematics</H3></A>One advantage of LaTeX is that it can 
automatically number equations and refer to these equation numbers in text. 
While plain TeX's method of equation numbering (explicit numbering using 
<B><CODE>\leqno</B></CODE>) works in the SIAM macro, it is not preferred except 
in certain cases. SIAM style guidelines call for aligned equations in many 
circumstances, and LaTeX's <B><CODE>{eqnarray} </B></CODE>environment is not 
compatible with <B><CODE>\leqno </B></CODE>and LaTeX is not compatible with the 
plain TeX command <B><CODE>\eqalign </B></CODE>and 
<B><CODE>\leqalignno</B></CODE>. Since SIAM may have to alter or realign certain 
groups of equations, it is necessary to use the LaTeX system of automatic 
numbering.
<P>Sometimes it is desirable to designate subequations of a larger equation 
number. The subequations are designated with (roman font) letters appended after 
the number. SIAM has supplemented its macros with the <B><CODE>subeqn.clo 
</B></CODE>option which defines the environment 
<B><CODE>{subequations}</B></CODE>. 
<P><B><PRE>\begin{subequations}\label{EKx}
\begin{equation} y_k =  B   y_{k-1} +  f, \qquad k=1,2,3,\ldots  
\end{equation}
for  any initial vector $ y_0$.   Then 
\begin{equation} 
y_k\rightarrow  u \mbox{\quad iff\quad} \rho( B) &lt; 1.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
</PRE></B>All equations within the <B><CODE>{subequations} 
</B></CODE>environment will keep the same overall number, but the letter 
designation will increase.
<P>Clear equation formatting using TeX can be challenging. Aside from the 
regular TeX documentation, authors will find Nicholas J. Higham's book 
<EM>Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences</EM> <A 
href="http://www.siam.org/tex/journals/docutex.htm#note1">[1]</A> useful for 
guidelines and tips on formatting with TeX. The book covers many other topics 
related to article writing as well. Authors commonly make mistakes by using 
<B><CODE>&lt; </B></CODE>, <B><CODE>&gt; </B></CODE>, <B><CODE>\mid</B></CODE>, 
and <B><CODE>\parallel </B></CODE>as delimiters, instead of 
<B><CODE>\langle</B></CODE>, <B><CODE>\rangle</B></CODE>, <B><CODE>|</B></CODE>, 
and <B><CODE>\|</B></CODE>. The incorrect symbols have particular meanings 
distinct from the correct ones and should not be confused.
<P><IMG src="USING SIAM'S LaTeX MACROS_files/table.gif">
<P>Another common author error is to put large (and even medium sized) matrices 
in-line with the text, rather than displaying them. This creates unattractive 
line spacing problems, and should be assiduously avoided. Text-sized matrices 
might be used but anything much more complex than single character entries (no 
superscipts) will not be easy to read and should be displayed. 
<P>More information on the formatting of equations and aligned equations is 
found in Lamport [2]. Authors bear primary responsibility for formatting their 
equations within margins and in an aesthetically pleasing and informative 
manner. 
<H3>4. Special fonts</H3>SIAM supports the use of the AMS-TeX fonts (version 2.0 
and later). The package <B><CODE>amsfonts </B></CODE>can be included with the 
command <B><CODE>\usepackage{amsfonts}</B></CODE>. This package is part of the 
AMS-LaTeX distribution, available from the <A 
href="ftp://e-math.ams.org/ams/amsfonts/latex/">AMS</A> or from the <A 
href="http://ctan.tug.org/pub/tex/ctan/fonts/amsfonts/">Comprehensive TeX 
Archive Network </A>(CTAN). The blackboard bold font in this font package is can 
be used for designating number sets. This is preferable to other methods of 
combining letters (such as I and R for the real numbers) to produce pseudo-bold 
letters but this is tolerable as well. Typographically speaking, number sets may 
simply be designated using regular bold letters; the blackboard bold typeface 
was designed to fulfil a desire to simulate the limitations of a chalk board in 
printed type. 
<H4>4.1. Punctuation</H4>All standard punctuation and all numerals should be set 
in roman type (upright) even within italic text. The only exceptions are periods 
and commas. They may be set to match the surrounding text.
<P>References to sections should use the section symbol, generated by<B><CODE> 
\S</B></CODE>. (If the reference begins a sentence, the term "Section" should be 
spelled out in full.) Authors should not redefine <B><CODE>\S</B></CODE>, say, 
to be a calligraphic S, because <B><CODE>\S </B></CODE>must be reserved for use 
as the section symbol. 
<P>Authors sometimes confuse the use of various types of dashes. Hyphens 
(<B><CODE>-</B></CODE>, -) are used for some compound words (many such words 
should have no hyphen but must be run together, like "nonzero," or split apart, 
like "well defined." Minus signs (<B><CODE> $-$</B></CODE>) should be used in 
math to represent subtraction or negative numbers. En dashes 
(<B><CODE>--</B></CODE>) are used for ranges (like 3--5, June--August), or for 
joined names (like Runge--Kutta). Em dashes (<B><CODE>---</B></CODE>) are used 
to set off a clause---such as this one---from the rest of the sentence. 
<H4>4.2. Text formatting</H4>SIAM style preferences do not make regular use of 
the <B><CODE>{enumerate} </B></CODE>and <B><CODE>{itemize} 
</B></CODE>environments. Instead, <B><CODE>siamltex.cls </B></CODE>includes 
definitions of two alternate listenvironments, <B><CODE>{remunerate} 
</B></CODE>and <B><CODE>{romannum}</B></CODE>. Unlike the standard itemized 
lists, these environments do not indent the secondary lines of text. The labels, 
whether default or the optional user-defined, are always aligned flush right.
<P>The <B><CODE>{remunerate} </B></CODE>environment consecutively numbers each 
item with an arabic numeral followed by a period. This number is always upright, 
even in slanted environments. (For those wondering at the unusual naming of this 
environment, it comes from Seroul and Levy's <A 
href='http://www.siam.org/tex/journals/docutex.htm#note3"'>[3]</A> definition of 
a similar macro for plain \TeX: <B><CODE>\meti </B></CODE>which is 
<B><CODE>\item </B></CODE>spelled backwards. Thus, 
<B><CODE>{remunerate}</B></CODE>, a portion of <B><CODE>{enumerate} 
</B></CODE>spelled backwards.) The <B><CODE>{romannum} </B></CODE>environment 
consecutively numbers each item with a lower-case roman numeral enclosed in 
parentheses. This number will always be upright within slanted environments (as 
in theorems). 
<H3>5. Theorems and lemmas</H3>Theorems, lemmas, corollaries, definitions, and 
propositions are covered in the SIAM macros by the theorem-environments 
<B><CODE>{theorem}</B></CODE>, <B><CODE>{lemma}</B></CODE>, 
<B><CODE>{corollary}</B></CODE>, <B><CODE>{definition}</B></CODE>, and 
<B><CODE>{proposition}</B></CODE>. These are all numbered in the same sequence 
and produce labels in small caps with an italic body. Other environments may be 
specified by the <B><CODE>\newtheorem </B></CODE>command. SIAM's style is for 
Remarks and Examples to appear as italic labels with upright roman body. 
<P><B><PRE>\begin{theorem} Sample theorem included for illustration.  
Numbers and parentheses, like  equation $(3.2)$, should be 
set in roman type.  Note that words (as opposed to 
``log-like''functions) in  displayed equations, such as
$$
 x^2 = Y^2 \sin z^2 \hbox{ for all } x 
$$
will appear in italic type in a  theorem, though normally
they should appear in roman.\end{theorem}
</PRE></B>This sample produces Theorem 5.1 below. 
<P><QUOTATION>T<FONT size=-1>HEOREM</FONT> 5.1. <EM>Sample theorem included for 
illustration. Numbers and parentheses, like equation</EM> (3.2), <EM>should be 
set in roman type. Note that words (as opposed to ``log-like'' functions) in 
displayed equations, such as
<P><!<img src ="eqn.gif" align=center>
<P>will appear in italic type in a theorem, though normally they should appear 
in roman.</EM> </QUOTATION>
<P>Proofs are handled with the <B><CODE>\begin{proof} 
</B></CODE><B><CODE>\end{proof} </B></CODE>environment. A ``QED'' box <!<img src="endproof.gif">is created automatically by 
<B><CODE>\end{proof}</B></CODE>, but this should be preceded with a 
<B><CODE>\qquad</B></CODE>.
<P>Named proofs, if used, must be done independently by the authors. SIAM style 
specifies that proofs which end with displayed equations should have the QED box 
two ems (<B><CODE>\qquad</B></CODE>) from the end of the equation on line with 
it horizontally. Below is an example of how this can be done:
<P><B><PRE>{\em Proof}. Proof of the previous theorem.
.
.
.
thus,
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \qquad\endproof$$
</PRE></B>
<H3>6. Figures and tables</H3>Figures and tables sometimes require special 
consideration. Tables in SIAM style are set to appear in eight point size, and 
they should be written so that they do not extend beyond the text margins. 
<P>SIAM style requires that no figures or tables appear in the references 
section of the paper. LaTeX is notorious for making figure placement difficult, 
so it is important to pay particular attention to figure placement near the 
references in the text. All figures and tables should be referred to in the 
text.
<P>SIAM supports the use of <B><CODE>graphics </CODE></B>package for including 
PostScript figures. All PostScript figures should be sent in separate files. See 
the <B><CODE>graphics </CODE></B>package documentation (available from <A 
href="ftp://ftp.cise.ufl.edu/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics">CTAN</A>) 
for more details on the use of this style option. It is a good idea to submit 
high-quality hardcopy of all PostScript figures just in case there is difficulty 
in the reproduction of the figure. Figures produced by other non-TeX methods 
should be included as high-quality hardcopy when the manuscript is submitted.
<P>PostScript figures that are sent should be generated with sufficient line 
thickness. Some past figures authors have sent had their line widths become very 
faint when SIAM set the papers using a high-quality 1200dpi printer. Hardcopy 
for non-PostScript figures should be included in the submission of the hardcopy 
of the manuscript. Space should be left in the <B><CODE>{figure} 
</CODE></B>command for the hardcopy to be inserted in production.
<P>
<H3>7. Bibliography and BibTeX</H3>If using BibTeX, authors need not submit the 
<B><CODE>.bib </CODE></B>file for their papers. Merely submit the completed 
<B><CODE>.bbl </CODE></B>file, having used <B><CODE>siam.bst</CODE></B> as their 
bibliographic style file. <B><CODE>siam.bst</CODE></B> only works with BibTeX 
version 99i and later. The use of BibTeX and the preparation of a <B><CODE>.bib 
</CODE></B>file is described in greater detail in <A 
href="http://www.siam.org/tex/journals/docutex.htm#note1">[1]</A> and <A 
href="http://www.siam.org/tex/journals/docutex.htm#note2">[2]</A>.
<P>If not using BibTeX, SIAM bibliographic references follow the format of the 
following examples: 
<P><B><PRE>  \bibitem{Ri} {\sc W. Riter}, {\em Title of a paper appearing in a 
  book}, in The Book  Title, E.~D. One, E.~D. Two, and 
  A.~N. Othereditor, eds., Publisher, Location, 1992, pp.~000--000.
  
  \bibitem{AuTh1} {\sc A.~U. Thorone}, {\em Title of paper with lower 
  case letters}, SIAM J. Abbrev. Correctly, 2(1992), pp.~000--000.
  
  \bibitem{A1A2} {\sc A.~U. Thorone and A.~U. Thortwo}, {\em Title 
  of paper appearing in book}, in Book Title: With All
  Initial Caps, Publisher,  Location, 1992.
  
  \bibitem{A1A22} \sameauthor, % generates the 3 em rule
  {\em Title of Book{\rm :} Note Initial Caps and {\rm ROMAN TYPE} 
  for Punctuation and Acronyms}, Publisher, Location, pp.~000--000, 1992.
  
  \bibitem{AuTh3} {\sc A.~U. Thorthree}, {\em Title of paper
  that's not published  yet}, SIAM. J. Abbrev. Correctly, 
  to appear.
</PRE></B>Other types of references fall into the same general pattern. See the 
sample file or any SIAM journal for other examples. Authors must correctly 
format their bibliography to be considered as having used the macros correctly. 
An incorrectly formatted bibliography is not only time-consuming for SIAM to 
process but it is possible that errors may be introduced into it by 
keyboarders/copy editors.
<P>As an alternative to the above style of reference, an alphanumeric code may 
be used in place of the number (e.g., [AUTh90]). The same commands are used, but 
<B><CODE>\bibitem </B></CODE>takes an optional argument containing the desired 
alphanumeric code. 
<P>Another alternative is no number, simply the authors' names and the year of 
publication following in parentheses. The rest of the format is identical. The 
macros do not support this alternative directly, but modifications to the macro 
definition are possible if this reference style is preferred.
<P>
<H3>8. Conclusion</H3>Many other style suggestions and tips could be given to 
help authors but are beyond the scope of this document. Simple mistakes can be 
avoided by increasing your familiarity with how LaTeX functions. The books 
referred to throughout this document are also useful to the author who wants 
clear, beautiful typography with minimal mistakes. 
<P>
<H3>Appendix. The use of appendices</H3>The <B><CODE>\appendix 
</B></CODE>command may be used before the final sections of a paper to designate 
them as appendices. Once <B><CODE>\appendix </B></CODE>is called, all subsequent 
sections will appear as 
<P><B>Appendix A. Title of appendix.</B> Each one will be sequentially lettered 
instead of numbered. Theorem-like environments, subsections, and equations will 
also have the section number changed to a letter.
<P>If there is only <EM>one</EM> appendix, however, the <B><CODE>\Appendix 
</B></CODE>(with a capital letter) should be used instead. This produces only 
the word <B>Appendix</B> in the section title, and does not add a letter. 
Equation numbers, theorem numbers and subsections of the appendix will have the 
letter "A" designating the section number.
<P>If you don't want to title your appendix, and just call it <B>Appendix A.</B> 
for example, use <B><CODE>\appendix\section*{} </B></CODE>and don't include 
anything in the title field. This works opposite to the way <B><CODE>\section* 
</B></CODE>usually works, by including the section number, but not using a 
title.
<P>Appendices should appear before the bibliography section, not after, and any 
acknowledgments should be placed after the appendices and before the 
bibliography.
