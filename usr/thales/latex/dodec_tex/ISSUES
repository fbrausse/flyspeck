% Phone Conversation July 2008. Things for Sean to do:
% These have pretty much all been done now. (TCH).

% -- Set up google code site.
% -- Put all the computer code in generally accessible form.
% -- Put a list of all the LP inequalities at google code, preferrably in hypermap form, in a format similar to dodec_appendix.tex
%
%
% -- Insert the definition of tameness into the article, as it is defined in Isabelle.
% -- In the section on Formal Proof 3.3, insert about 5 citations.
% -- Fix the numbering so that Definitions, Lemmas, Theorems, etc. are numbered collectively.
% -- Add bibliographic information in Knitro citation \cite{Kni}.
% -- Add bibliographic information for google code repository.
% -- Each citation \cite{code} should be expanded to \cite[exact reference]{code} where appropriate.
% -- Look at the numerical constant used to approximate omega_dod in the linear programs.  Change the exponent of 10^{-10} as needed to make it compatible.
% -- The footnote about the typo at the end of Section 6.5: make sure that the typo does not affect the actual calculations.
% -- Review each of the notes marked "FIXX" in the text, to see which you can resolve.


% Other things to do together that were discussed on 6/26:
% -- Make a list of interval arithmetic calculations used in the paper, but not in LP.
% -- Add an index.
% -- shorten the discussion of the graph generator?


% Things to consider doing:
% -- Expand the summary in 3.8.
% -- Make the top-level structure (the narrative, the purpose) clearer; 
% -- explanation of the role of mu, omega,....
