This directory contains various files created by Thomas Hales
that are not essential for the Flyspeck project.

The latex directory contains the LaTeX source of various
papers written by Hales during the period 2007-2014.  Only
some of them are Flyspeck related.

The projects_discrete_geometry contains calculations in discrete
geometry that are not part of the flyspeck project.
This includes the calculations for the strong dodecahedral conjecture,
Fejes Toth's conjecture that a packing in which each sphere touches 12 others
consists of hexagonal layers, calculations related to the BCC lattice,
and calculations related to a paper by Bezdek and Reid.

The search and session directories contains files used by Hales to create and search
for theorems in the Flyspeck project.  They are no longer used now that
the formalization project is complete.
