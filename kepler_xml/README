This directory is a branch of kepler_tex used for converting the book to XML
(currently XHTML+MathML, but in principle we could also do OMDoc).  Michael had
to make some modifications to the original files.

version2007.tex.xml	the intermediate XML generated by LaTeXML
version2007.xhtml	XHTML+MathML generated from that by LaTeXMLPost

Note: Dec 26, 2008.
The files in this directory are completely out of date and should be avoided.
I am (temporarily) deleting a few files that should be especially avoided.
