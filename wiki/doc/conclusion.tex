\label{sec:conc}

The experiments with Semantic MediaWiki and SWiM led to the conclusion to
integrate further support for Flyspeck in SWiM, using its rich semantic web and
OMDoc infrastructure.  For the text-based
page format of MediaWiki, features that rely on structures like the linking
of symbols could only be realized in a very prototypical way using regular expressions.  Relying on the XML
infrastructure of OMDoc, these features are easier to develop or already
available.  However, rapidly \emph{prototyping} our first ideas about the wiki
support required for Flyspeck was easier in Semantic MediaWiki due to its
ability to design ad-hoc ontologies and its implementation in the interpreted
language PHP.

For this case study, we created import-ready OMDoc from Twelf, but OMDoc also
offers support for the alternative workflow of stepwise formalization
as well.  One could either start with
converting the Flyspeck book from {\LaTeX} to HTML with Presentation MathML
formul√¶ and formalize the presentation markup into content markup step by step,
or one could start the formalization on the {\TeX} side.  There, one would
formalize the book to s\TeX{}, a content-oriented {\TeX} notation for OMDoc,
which can then be converted to OMDoc\cite{Kohlhase:albwo06}.  Either way
involves a {\TeX}-to-XML transformation, which has been tested in large scale in
our group\cite{URL:arXMLiv}.

If several parts of the proof are done in different theorem provers, highly non-trivial and mostly novel translations become necessary to provide one single proof object. Here OMDoc could be used as an excange format between ATP languages, and formal translations could be specified in OMDoc itself. However, it is not at all clear yet what kind of translations will be needed eventually.

Furthermore, using the module system of OMDoc could help to simplify the structure of the proof. In any case it can be used to explicate the dependencies between components of the proof. And search in the proof will be greatly simplified if the semantic-aware search engine MathWebSearch\cite{KohSuc:asemf06} is used, which applies substitution tree indexing to mathematical formulae.

\ednote{@Christoph: Needs to support both preloaded and ad-hoc ontologies: The OMDoc
  document ontology is preloaded, while other annotations can be added at will. (Make SWiM
  more ``wiki''!)}

  NarCons\cite{KohMueMue:dfncimk07}; need to be added to document ontology.}
