Documents are the most important medium in science, if we assume a broad definition of
``document'', including any materialized item of (scientific) knowledge.  Scientific
communication mainly consists of exchanging documents---from informal drafts circulating
inside a working group to published, well-structured books.  A great deal of scientific
work consists of collaboratively authoring these documents---taking down first hypotheses,
commenting on results of experiments or project steps, as well as structuring, annotating,
and re-organizing existing items of knowledge.  Tools that
\emph{understand} the knowledge contained in scientific documents are desirable for
editing such documents.  One approach towards this is writing scientific documents in a
semantic markup language with an editor that knows the structures available in this
language.

Besides generic approaches like SALT\cite{Groza:SALT07}, semantic markup has been most
deeply investigated in the specific domain of mathematics with ``long tradition in the
pursuit of conceptual clarity and representational rigor''\cite{Kohlhase:omdoc1.2},
resulting in languages like MathML\cite{CarlisleEd:MathML07},
OpenMath\cite{BusCapCar:2oms04}, and OMDoc\cite{Kohlhase:omdoc1.2}.  OMDoc is a language
that employs Content MathML
%% \ednote{I don't think we want this footnote.  It uses space, and if the users
%%   are curious about the difference, which doesn't seem relevant to our papre, they

%% \footnote{MathML comes in two flavors: Presentation MathML

%%   structure.  Formal mathematical software like a Computer Algebra System would export
%%   formulae in Content MathML, but for publishing, they would be converted to Presentation
%%   MathML.} 
or OpenMath for structurally representing mathematical \emph{objects} (symbols,
numbers, equations, etc.) and adds two layers on top of that: Objects or informal text can
be annotated as mathematical \emph{statements} (symbol declarations, definitions, axioms,
theorems, proofs, examples, etc.), and collections of interrelated statements are grouped
into \emph{theories}.

With SWiM, a semantic wiki for mathematical knowledge management (see
section~\ref{sec:swim}), we have investigated collaborative editing of OMDoc documents.
It has turned out that a wiki is a suitable tool for supporting the workflow of
incremental formalization inherent to scientific writing.  But wikis have not only shown
to be appropriate for \emph{writing}, but also for project management, e.\,g.\ in
corporate settings\cite{leuf01:wikiway}.  Thus, we are interested in applying our
technologies to scientific knowledge engineering projects.
