\SYNOPSIS
A synopsis of the various types of differentiation in HOL Light.

\DESCRIBE

`has_derivative` is the primary concept, defined in theorems
  "has_derivative", "has_derivative_within"
  The derivative of `f:real^A->real^B` is a linear  `f':real^A->real^B`.

`frechet_derivative` is defined as `(@f'. (f has_derivative f') net))`

`differentiable` defined as  `(?f'. (f has_derivative f') net))`

A lambda abstraction turns a deriviative, viewed as a constant, into a
linear function in the following special forms:

`has_complex_derivative` specialized `(f:real^2->real^2) has_derivative (\x. f' * x)`

`has_vector_derivative` specialized `(f:real^1->real^N) has_derivative (\x. drop x % f')`

`has_real_derivative` specialized to `f:real->real` with lift and drop.


Many theorems have a "within" variant that restricts the net to a set s.
