%% XX issues.

We mark warnings with the letters WW in 
the TeX file.

We mark serious issues with the letters XX.

\section{Notation}

We use the notation $]x,y[$ in trig.tex, then move away from it.

\section{Definitions}

Some definitions are repeated ($\Delta$, $\dtet$, etc.)
Mark these in some way.

Is the notation $(p_x,p_y,p_z)$ for coordinates 
of $p\in R^3$ consistent throughout?

Use the word simplex combinatorially for four vertices.
Use the word tetrahedron geometrically for the convex hull.

barrier should be closed. Intersecting segment should be open ended.
(Open ends prevent meeting at a vertex.)
Everything will be done up to a null set
anyway for measure related things.

\section{Define before use}

Make sure circle, great circle are defined before use.
A good place would be in vector geoemtry chapter.

Define basic notions of $\op{aff}$, $\op{conv}$, $\op{cone}$
before first use, as in vector geometry chapter.


\section{Policy Things}

Here we list some things that have been changed.  Make sure that
all occurences have been eliminated.

There should be no mention of enumerated packings.

Indexing: Things before the ``AT'' symbol are used for ordering entries.
Things after used for display in the actual index.
Subentry is!  After vertical slash stuff gets passed to page
number.  \\index{policy|bold}  puts the page in bold.
\\index{policy|(} starts a subrange \\index{policy|)} ends a page range.

Make all Deltas take same args in same order (to simplify formal proofs).
$\chi$, $\Delta$, $\ups$ should appear only in tarski.tex. 

\section{Incomplete Things in Tarski}

Eventually, I want to separate out the Tarski stuff, quoting
only the results that are needed.  Quote by footnote. Index every use.

Need an introduction to Tarski. What it is all about.

Replace $y_i$ by $y_{jk}$ globally.
