\chapter{Cyclic Fan}\label{sec:cyclic}


\begin{summary}
At various times, it is useful to focus attention on a single face in a fan.  This leads to a construction of a what is called the localization of a fan along a face.  The localization is again a fan.  Special properties of the localized fan are captured in the notion of a cyclic fan.  The upper bound $2\pi$ on the perimeter of a cyclic fan is established.


To focus attention on a particular face $F$ of a fan $(V,E)$, it is useful to disregard all the vertices
and edges of the fan, except for the vertices and edges that constitute $F$.  This pared down fan
is an example of a {\it cyclic fan}, which is defined below.  It can be viewed as a ``localization'' of
the fan along a face $F$.  

A theory of deformations of cyclic fans is developed.  Sufficient conditions are stated for the deformation of a cyclic fan to remain a cyclic fan.

\subsection{basics}


\begin{definition}[cyclic fan]  A triple $(V,E,F)$ is a {\it cyclic fan} if the following conditions hold.
\begin{nomerate} 
\item \case{fan} $(V,E)$ is a fan;
\item \case{face} $F$ is a face of $H = \op{hyp}(V,E)$;
\item \case{cyclic hypermap} $H$ is isomorphic to $H_{2k}$, where $k = \card(F)$;
\item \case{angle} $\op{azim}(x)\le \pi$ for all darts $x\in F$; and
\item \case{wedge} $V\subset \bWdart(x)$ for all $x\in F$.
%\item If $\{\v,\w\}\in E$, then $\{\orz,\v,\w\}$ is not collinear. %% part of def of fan.
\end{nomerate}
\end{definition}
\indy{Index}{fan!cyclic}%

The intersection of $X(V,E)$ with the unit sphere is a spherical polygon, when $(V,E,F)$ is a cyclic fan.  The spherical polygon gives a visual representation of the cyclic fan. The choice of $F$ distinguishes the ``interior'' of the polygon from its exterior.  The final two conditions are convexity constraints.  



\begin{lemma}\guid{WRGCVDR}\rating{ZZ}  
For any cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$, there is a bijection from $F$ onto $V$ given by
$$
 (\v,\w) \mapsto \v
$$
Moreover, write $\v\mapsto(\v,\rho\v)$ for the inverse map. 
Then $\rho:V\to V$ is a cyclic permutation.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $(\v,\rho \v)\in D$, for all $\v\in V$; and
%\item 
%$$f(\v,\w) = (\w,\sigma(\w)^{-1}\v)= (\w,\rho \w)$$ for all $(\v,\w)\in F$.
%\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{cyclic permutation}%

\begin{proof}  The map from the set of nodes to a face is a bijection for the cyclic hypermap $H_{2k}$, hence it is a bijection for cyclic fans.

For all $(\v,\rho \v)\in F$,
$$f(\v,\rho \v) = (\rho\v,\rho^2\v),$$
so that the order of $\rho$ on $V$ is the order of $f$ on $F$, which is $k=\card(F)$.  Thus, $\rho$ is a cyclic permutation of $V$ of order $k=\card(V)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[$\rho$,~$\v$]  For any cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$, 
write $\v:F\to V$ and $\rho:V\to V$ for the bijections of the preceding lemma.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[interior angle,~$\angle$,~$\bWdart$]
For any cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$,
 write
$$
\angle(\v) = \op{azim}((\v,\rho\v)),
$$
for all $\v\in V$.  This is the {\it interior} angle of the cyclic fan at $\v$.
Also, write
$$
\Wdart(F,\v) = \Wdart((\v,\rho \v)),\quad \bWdart(F,\v) =\bWdart((\v,\rho \v)).

\begin{definition}[localization]  Let $(V,E)$ be a fan, and let $F$ be a face of $\op{hyp}(V,E)$.  
Let 
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
V' &= \{\v\in V \mid \exists~\w\in V.~(\v,\w)\in F\}.\\
E' &= \{\{\v,\w\} \in E\mid (\v,\w)\in F\}.
\end{array}
$$
The pair $(V',E')$ is called the {\it localization} of $(V,E)$ along $F$.
\end{definition}
\indy{Index}{localization}%


\begin{lemma}[localization]\guid{LVDUCXU}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:localization}  
Let $(V,E)$ be any fan, and let $F$ be a face of its hypermap.  
Then the localization $(V',E')$ is a fan, and $F$ is a face of $\op{hyp}(V',E')$.  Moreover, the hypermap $\op{hyp}(V',E')$ is isomorphic
to $H_{2k}$, where $k= \card(F)$.
 Finally, the values $\op{azim}(x)$ and $\Wdart(x)$  do not depend
whether they computed relative to $\op{hyp}(V,E)$ or to $\op{hyp}(V',E')$, for all $x\in F$.
%That is, 
%$$
%\begin{array}{lll}
%\op{azim}(V,E,x) &=\op{azim}(V',E',x)\\
%\Wdart(V,E,x) &=\Wdart(V',E',x)\\
%\end{array}
%$$
\end{lemma}



\begin{proof}
The proof that  $(V',E')$ is a fan is a sequence of simple verifications based on
the techniques of Remark~\ref{remark:fan-verify}.  The details are left to the reader.

The dart set $D'$ of $\op{hyp}(V',E')$ is naturally identified with the disjoint union $F\cup F'$, where
$F = \{(\v,\w) \in F\}$ and $F'=\{(\w,\v) \mid (\v,\w)\in F\}$.  Under this identification, $F$ is a face of $\op{hyp}(V',E')$.  The edge map $e(\v,\w)= (\w,\v)$ is a bijection of $F$ onto $F'$.   Pick any $x\in F$ and
define a bijection from the disjoint union of two copies of the cyclic group $Z_k$ onto $D'$  by 
the pair of maps
$$
i \mapsto f^i x,\quad\text{ and } i\mapsto e f^i x.
$$
This bijection extends to an isomorphism of hypermaps $H_{2k}$ onto $\op{hyp}(V',E')$.

The proof that the $\op{azim}(x)$ and $\Wdart(x)$ do not depend on the choice of fan is a consequence of their definitions:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\op{azim}(x) &= \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\w,\sigma(\v,\w)),\\
\Wdart(x) &= \Wdart(\orz,\v,\w,\sigma(\v,\w)).\\
\end{array}
$$
where $x = (\v,\w)$.    It is enough to check that $\sigma(\v,\w)\in E'(\v)$. 
But $\{\sigma(\v,\w),\v\}\in F$, so this is indeed the case.
%In particular $\op{azim}(x)\le\pi$ follow by the assumptions of the lemma.
\end{proof}



\subsection{geometric types}\label{sec:types}

\begin{definition}[generic,~lunar,~circular]
A cyclic fan $(V,E)$ is {\it generic} if for every $\{\v,\w\}\in E$
and every $\u\in V$, 
$$
C\{\v,\w\}\cap C^0_-\{\u\} = \emptyset.
$$
A cyclic fan is {\it circular} if there exists $\u\in V$ and $\{\v,\w\}\in E$ such that 
$$
C^0\{\v,\w\}\cap C^0_-\{\u\}\ne \emptyset.
$$
A cyclic fan is {\it lunar} with dependency $\v,\w$ if it is not circular and if $\v$ and $\w$ are distinct and dependent elements of $V$.
\end{definition}
\indy{Index}{generic}%
\indy{Index}{lunar}%
\indy{Index}{circular}%

\begin{lemma}\guid{CIZMRRH}\rating{ZZ} Every cyclic fan is
generic, lunar, or circular.  Moreover, these three properties are mutually exclusive.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{fan!cyclic}%
\indy{Index}{cyclic fan}%
\indy{Index}{generic}%
\indy{Index}{lunar}%
\indy{Index}{circular}%

\begin{proof} If $(V,E,F)$ is not generic,  select some $\{\v,\w\}\in E$
and some $\u\in V$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:non-generic}
C\{\v,\w\}\cap C^0_-\{\u\} \ne \emptyset.
\end{equation}
Now $C\{\v,\w\} = C^0\{\v,\w\} \cup C\{\v\}\cup C\{\w\}$.  
If, for some such triple $(\u,\v,\w)$, the intersection~(\ref{eqn:non-generic}) meets $C^0\{\v,\w\}$, then the cyclic fan is circular.  
Otherwise, the cyclic fan is lunar. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{LDURDPN}\rating{ZZ}  \label{lemma:coplanar}
Assume that $\u$ and $\w\in\ring{R}^3$ are independent, as well as $\u$ and $\v$.  Then $\op{azim}(\orz,\u,\v,\w)=\pi$
if and only if there exists a plane $A$ such that
$S=\{\orz,\u,\v,\w\}\subset A$ and such that the line $\op{aff}\{\orz,\u\}$ separates $\v$ from $\w$ in $A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  The given azimuth angle is $\pi$ if and only if $\dih(\{\orz,\u\},\{\v,\w\})=\pi$.  This holds
exactly when $S$ is coplanar and the line $\op{aff}\{\orz,\u\}$ separates $\v$ from $\w$ in $A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{KOMWBWC}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:kom}
Let $(V,E,F)$ be a cyclic fan.  Let $k=\card(F)$.  Assume that for some $0<r\le k-1$ and some $\v\in V$, the set $U=\{\v,\rho \v,\ldots,\rho^r \v\}$ is contained in a plane $A$ passing through $\orz$.  Let $\e$ be the unit normal to $A$ in the direction $\v\times \rho \v$.  Then 
the set $U$ is cyclic with respect to $(\orz,\e)$, and the azimuth cycle $\sigma$ on $U$ is 
$$
\sigma \u = \begin{cases} \rho \u, & \u\ne \rho^r\v,\\ \v, & \u = \rho^r\v.\end{cases}
$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
Write $\v_i = \rho^i \v$, for $i=0,\ldots,r$.

\claim{ 
$(\v_i \times \v_{i+1})\cdot \e > 0$, for all $i\le r-1$. }
Indeed, the base case of an induction  $(\v_0\times \v_1)\cdot \e > 0$ holds by assumption.    
Assume for a contradiction that the inequality holds for $i$, but not for $i+1$.
Then 
$$\op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_{i+1}\},\v_i) = \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_{i+1}\},\v_{i+2}).$$ 
This forces $C^0\{\v_i,\v_{i+1}\}$ to meet $C^0\{\v_{i+1},\v_{i+2}\}$, which
is contrary to the definition of a fan.  Thus, the claim holds.

The fact that $U$ is cyclic follows trivially from the fact that $U$ is contained in a plane $A$ through $\orz$ and that $\e$ is orthogonal to $A$.

\claim{For all $0\le i \le r-1$,  $\sigma \v_i = \v_{i+1}$.}
Otherwise, there is some 
$$\u \in (U\setminus \{\v_i,\v_{i+1}\}) \cap W^0(\orz,\e,\v_i,\v_{i+1}) \cap A.
%  ~~\subset~~ 
$$
However, this intersection is a subset of $C^0\{\v_i,\v_{i+1}\}$,
and $\u\in C^0\{\v_i,\v_{i+1}\}$ is contrary to the property \case{intersection} of fans.  The result follows.
%The membership of $\u$ in the rightmost term is contrary to the definition of fan.  
%Let $\e_3$ be the unit vector in the direction $\v\times \u$.  Let $\e_1$ be the unit vector in the direction $\u$.
%Let $\e_2 = \e_3 \times \e_1$.  The coordinates of $\u,\v,\w$ with respect to the orthonormal frame $(\e_1,\e_2,\e_3)$ take the form
%$$
%\begin{array}{rllrl}
%\v &= * \e_1 + a \e_2,  &\quad & a &< 0\\
%\u &= a' \e_1, &\quad & a' &>0\\
%\w&= * \e_1 + a'' \e_2, &\quad & a'' &>0\\
%\end{array}
%$$
%From this representation it is clear that $\v\times \u$ points in the same direction as $\u\times \w$.
%The set $\{\v,\u,\w\}$ is clearly cyclic and the counterclockwise cycle $\sigma$ in the $\{\e_1,\e_2\}$ plane
%takes $\v$ to $\u$ and $\u$ to $\w$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{OZQVSFF}\rating{ZZ} \label{lemma:A}  Let $(V,E,F)$ be a cyclic fan and let
$\u,\v,\w\in V$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{\orz,\u,\v,\w\}$ is contained in a plane $A$; \vspace{3pt}
\item $\u,\w\not\in\op{aff}\{\orz,\v\}$; and \vspace{3pt}
\item $\op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v\},\u) \ne \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v\},\w)$.
\end{itemize}
Then $\angle(\v) = \pi$.  Moreover, $\rho \v,\rho^{-1} \v\in A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Let $x = (\v,\rho\v)\in F$.  
Order $\u$ and $\w$ so that
$$
\op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\u) \le \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\w).
$$
By the definition of cyclic fan, by the conditions $\u,\v\in \bWdart(x)$, 
and by  Lemma~\ref{lemma:coplanar},
%By the assumptions, $\dih(\{\orz,\v\},\{\u,\w\})=\pi$.  Since
%$\u,\w\in \bWdart(x)$, it follows that
%$$\pi = \dih(\{\orz,\v\},\{\u,\w\}) \le \op{azim}(x) = \angle(\v) \le \pi.$$
%The first conclusion follows.
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
0 &\le \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\u) \\
   &= \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\w) - \op{azim}(\orz,\v\,\u,\w)\\
    &= \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\w)-\pi \\
   &\le \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\rho^{-1}\v,\w) - \pi \\
   &=\op{azim}(x) - \pi \\
   &=\angle(\v)-\pi\\
   &\le 0. 
\end{array}
$$
Hence each inequality is equality.  In particular, $\angle(\v) = \pi$.
In particular, $0 =\op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\u)$, so that 
$$\rho\v\in \op{aff}_+(\{\orz,\v\},\u) \subset A.$$
Similarly,
$$
\rho^{-1}\v\in \op{aff}_+(\{\orz,\v\},\w) \subset A.
$$
\end{proof}

If Lemma~\ref{lemma:A} can be applied once, then it can often be applied repeatedly along a chain.  For example, the conclusion of the lemma implies
that $\rho^{-1} \v \in A$.  In fact, by the definition of fan, 
$$\rho^{-1}\v \in A \setminus \op{aff}\{\orz,\v\} = \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v\},\u) \cup \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v\},\w).$$
Suppose that $\rho^{-1} \v$ lies in the first term of the union.  If $\u\ne \rho^{-1}\v$, then the assumptions of the lemma
are met for $\{\u,\rho^{-1} \v,\v\}$, giving the conclusion $\angle(\rho^{-1} \v)=\pi$ and $\rho^{-2}\v\in A$.  Repeating, we obtain a chain
$$
\pi=\angle(\v) = \angle(\rho^{-1} \v) = \cdots,
$$
with $\v,\rho^{-1}\v,\ldots\in A$.  Another chain can be constructed in the other direction $\v,\rho \v,\ldots$.
This process of chaining gives the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}[circular geometry]\guid{KCHMAMG}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:circular}
Let $(V,E,F)$ be a circular fan. Then
\begin{itemize}
\item $\angle(\v)=\pi$, for all $\v\in V$.
\item The set $V$ lies in a plane $A$ through $\orz$.
\item For some choice of unit vector $\e$ orthogonal to $A$, the set $V$ is cyclic with respect to
$(\orz,\e)$, and the azimuth cycle on $V$ coincides with $\rho:V\to V$.
Also,
$$
\op{azim}(\orz,\e,\v,\rho\v) = \op{arc}_V(\orz,\{\v,\rho \v\}).
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Let $\v, \u\in V$ be such that $C^0\{\u,\rho \u\}$ meets $C^0_-\{\v\}$.  Apply
Lemma~\ref{lemma:A} to $\{\u,\v,\rho \u\}$ to conclude that $\angle(\v)=\pi$ and some plane $A$ contains
$\{\orz,\u,\rho\u,\v,\rho \v,\rho^{-1} \v\}$.  If 
$$
\{\orz,\u,\rho \u,\v,\rho \v,\rho^{-1} \v\} \subset V\cap A,
$$
and $\w\in V\cap A$, then there exists $\w_1,\w_2\in (V\cap A)\setminus\{\w\}$ for which
the assumptions of Lemma~\ref{lemma:A} hold.  Then $\angle(\w)=\pi$ and
$\rho \w \in V\cap A$.  The set $V\cap A$ is therefore preserved by $\rho$.
By observing that $V$ is the only nonempty subset of $V$ that is preserved by $\rho$,
 it follows that $V\subset A$.  


By Lemma~\ref{lemma:coplanar}, $V$ is cyclic with respect to a unit vector $\e$ orthogonal to $A$.  The
azimuth cycle on $V$ is $\v \mapsto \rho \v$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[lunar geometry]\guid{HKIRPEP}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:lunar}
Let $(V,E,F)$ be a lunar fan with dependent vectors $\v,\w\in V$.  
Assume that $\rho^r \v = \w$, for
some $0< r < k$.
Then
\begin{itemize}
\item $\angle(\u) = \pi$, for all $\u\in V\setminus \{\v,\w\}$; \vspace{3pt}
\item $0< \angle(\v) = \angle(\w)\le \pi$; \vspace{3pt}
\item $V\cap \op{aff}_+(\{\orz,\v\},\rho \v) = \{\v,\rho \v,\ldots, \w\}$; \vspace{3pt}
\item $V \cap \op{aff}_+(\{\orz,\v\},\rho^{-1} \v) = \{\w,\rho \w,\ldots \v\}$;  \vspace{3pt}
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}   Set $V_1 = \{\v,\rho \v,\ldots,\w\}$ and $V_2 = \{\w,\rho \w,\ldots,\v\}$. 
Let $\u\in V\setminus\{\v,\w\}$ be arbitrary.
Apply Lemma~\ref{lemma:A} to the set $\{\u,\v,\w\}$ to find that $\angle(\u)=\pi$ and
that $\{\orz,\u,\rho \u,\rho^{-1} \u\}$ belongs to a plane $A(\u)$.  Now $A(\u)$ and $A(\rho \u)$ are both the unique plane containing $\{\orz,\u,\rho \u\}$, hence $A(\u) = A(\rho \u)$ 
when $\rho \u\not\in \{\v,\w\}$.  By induction, there are planes $A_1, A_2$ such that $V_i\subset A_i$.  There is
an azimuth cycle $\sigma_i$ on $V_i$ such that $\sigma_i \u = \rho \u$, when $\u \in A_i\setminus \{\v,\w\}$.  

The angles $\angle(\v)$ and $\angle(\w)$ are both equal to the dihedral angle between these two half-planes.  In particular, $0<\angle(\v)=\angle(\w)\le\pi$.
\end{proof}




\begin{lemma}[monotonicity]\guid{EGHNAVX}\rating{ZZ}  \label{lemma:monotone}
Let $(V,E,F)$ be a cyclic fan. Fix $\v_0\in V$.  Assume that $\v_0$ and $\u$ are independent for all $\u\in V\setminus\{\v_0\}$.  For all $i$, set $\v_i = \rho^i \v_0$ and $\beta(i) = \op{azim}(\orz,\v_0,\v_1,\v_i)$.
Then
$$0=\beta(1)\le \beta(2)\le \cdots\le \beta(k-1)\le\pi.$$
Moreover, if $\beta(i)=0$ for some $1<i \le k-1$, then
$$
\angle(\v_1) = \cdots = \angle(\v_{i-1}) = \pi,
$$
and $\{\orz,\v_0,\ldots,\v_i\} \subset \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_0\},\v_1)$.
Finally, if $\beta(i)=\beta(k-1)$ for some $1\le i<k-1$ then 
$$
\angle(\v_{i+1}) = \cdots = \angle(\v_{k-1}) = \pi,
$$
and $\{\orz,\v_i,\ldots,\v_{k-1}\} \subset \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_0\},\v_{k-1})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  
Pick an orthonormal frame and write the points $\v_j$ in spherical coordinates $(r_j,\theta_j,\phi_j)$.  In an appropriate orthonormal frame, $\phi_0=0$, and $\theta_j=\beta(j)$, for all $j$.  From $\v_j\in \bWdart(F,\v_0)$ and $\angle(\v_0)\le\pi$, it follows that $0\le\theta_j\le\theta_{k-1}\le\pi$ when $0\le j\le k-1$.

 One may assume by induction that $0\le \beta(1)\le\cdots\le \beta(i)$.  The condition
$$
\v_0\in \bWdart(F,\v_i)
$$
implies that
$$
0 \le \op{azim}(\orz,\v_i,\v_{i+1},\v_0)\le \op{azim}(\orz,\v_i,\v_{i+1},\v_{i-1})\le\pi.
$$
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:sim}, the resulting inequality
$$
\sin(\op{azim}(\orz,\v_i,\v_{i+1},\v_0))\ge 0
$$
reduces to a triple-product:
$$
(\v_0 \times \v_i)\cdot \v_{i+1}\ge 0.
$$
In spherical coordinates, this inequality becomes
$$
r_0r_ir_{i+1}\sin\phi_i\sin\phi_{i+1}\sin(\theta_{i+1}-\theta_i)\ge0.
$$
Under the independence assumption, $\sin\phi_i\ne0$ and $\sin\phi_{i+1}\ne0$ (when $0< i < k-1$).    These inequalities give $\theta_i\le\theta_{i+1}$ (with a small extra argument to exclude the degenerate case $\theta_{i+1}=0,\theta_i=\pi$).  The conclusion follows by induction.

Assume that $\beta(i)=\theta_i=0$, for some $i>1$.  
Then $\v_1,\ldots,\v_i$ all lie in the
half-plane $\op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_0\},\v_1)$.  In particular, they are coplanar.  A chaining argument based on Lemma~\ref{lemma:A} gives the result.

The final conclusion is similar.
\end{proof}



\subsection{deformation}\label{sec:deformation}

This section considers deformations of a cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$.

\begin{definition}[deformation]
A {\it deformation} of a cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$ over an interval $I\subset\ring{R}$
is a 
continuous function $\varphi:V\times I \to\ring{R}^3$ (in the discrete topology on $V$ and the product topology on $V\times I$).
%The deformation is {\it flat} if whenever
%$$\{\orz,\varphi(\rho^{-1}\v,t),\varphi(\v,t),\varphi(\rho \v,t)\}$$
%is coplanar for $t=a\in I$, then also the set is coplanar for all $t\in I$ such
%that $t\ge a$.
\end{definition}
\indy{Index}{deformation}%
\indy{Index}{fan!cyclic}%
%\indy{Index}{flat}%

%That is, a flat deformation is a deformation in which certain linear
%dependencies are ``sticky;''  once the dependency is formed, the dependency endures.

Write $\v(t)$ as an abbreviation of $\varphi(\v,t)$, for $t\in I$.  
Also, set
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
V(t)&=\{\v(t) \mid \v\in V\},\\
E(t)&=\{\{\v(t),\w(t)\}\mid \{\v,\w\}\in E\},\\
F(t)&= \{(\v(t),\w(t)) \mid  (\v,\w)\in F\}.
\end{array}
$$


A deformation does not require $(V(t),E(t),F(t))$ to be a cyclic fan for all $t\in I$, although this will often be the case. The permutation $\rho:V\to V$ gives $\varphi(\rho \v,t)\in V(t)$, for every $\v\in V$.  


\begin{example}[lunar deformation]\label{example:lunar}
Consider a lunar cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$ with dependent $\v,\w\in V$.   Pick an orthonormal frame and spherical coordinates such that $\phi(\v)=0$, $\phi(\w)=\pi$.  $\theta(\rho \v)=0$, and $\theta(\rho^{-1} \v)=\theta_{k-1}\le\pi$.  Consider the deformation $\varphi$ over 
$I = \{t \mid 0 \le t < 1\}$
such that radial $r$ and zenith $\phi$ coordinates of $\varphi(\u,t)$ are constant as functions of $t$,
and the azimuth angle $\theta$ of $\varphi(\u,t)$ equals

$$
\begin{cases} 
   (1-t) \theta_{k-1} & \text{if } \u\in \{\rho \w,\rho^2 \w,\ldots, \rho^{-1} \v\};\\
   0 & \text{if } \u\in \{\rho \v,\rho^2 \v,\ldots,\rho^{-1} \w\}.\\
\end{cases}
$$
%This deformation $(V(t),E(t),F(t))$ is a cyclic fan for all $t\in I$.
%The cardinality of $V$ is independent of $t\in I$.
Note that $(V(0),E(0),F(0)) = (V,E,F)$.
\end{example}
\indy{Index}{lunar}%
\indy{Index}{spherical coordinates}%

\begin{lemma}\guid{HZIYFIZ}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:lunar-deform} 
Let $(V,E,F)$ be a lunar cylic fan with dependency $\v,\w\in V$.  In the deformation described above, the triple $(V(t),E(t),F(t))$ is a lunar cyclic fan for all $t\in I$.  The cardinality of $V$ is independent of $t\in I$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  The proof consists of checking  the properties of a lunar cyclic fan, one by one.   The verification of the property \case{V} follows from the methods of Remark~\ref{remark:fan-verify}.

The map $\varphi(\cdot,t)$ is invertible, so that $V(t)$ is in bijection with $V$.  In particular, the cardinality does not depend on $t$.

\case{origin} The radial spherical coordinate is nonzero for every element of $V(t)$.  Hence $V(t)$ does not contain $\orz$.

\case{independence}  For $\{\v,\rho \v\}\in E$, the angle 
$\alpha=\op{arc}_V(\orz,\{\varphi(\v,t),\varphi(\rho \v,t)\})$
is independent of $t$.  The independence property is equivalent to $\alpha\ne0,\pi$.  Thus, the independence property for $E$ implies
the independence for $E(t)$.

\case{intersection} The points $V(t)$ are contained in the union of two half-planes $A_1,A_t$.  The deformation is the identity on $A_1$ and an isometry $A_0\to A_t$ on the second half-plane.  These bijections preserve the incidence relations of blades of the cones $C(\ee)$.  

\case{cyclic hypermap}~\case{face} The combinatorial properties of the hypermap do not depend on $t$.  In particular, the hypermap has face $F(t)$ and the hypermap is isomorphic to $H_{2k}$.

\case{angle} The azimuth angle $\angle(\varphi(\u,t))$ is fixed when $\u\ne \v,\w$ and is decreasing in $t$ when $\u\in \{\v,\w\}$.  Hence, the upper bound on the angle is preserved.

\case{wedge}  $V(t)\subset A_0\cup A_t$, where $A_0$ and $A_t$ are the
half-planes described above.  Now $\bWdart(F,\varphi(\u,t))$ is a half-space containing $A_0$ and $A_t$ when $\u\ne \v,\w$.  Also, $\bWdart(F,\varphi(\u,t))$ is a wedge with bounding half-planes $A_0$ and $A_t$ when $\u\in \{\v,\w\}$.  Hence
$V(t)\subset A_0\cup A_t\subset \bWdart(F,\varphi(\u,t))$ for all $\u\in V$.

\case{lunar} The points $\v,\w\in V(t)$ remain fixed and hence remain dependent.  Thus, the cyclic fan remains lunar.  
\end{proof}
\indy{Index}{angle!azimuth}%

Next  consider a deformation of a cyclic fan.  The following lemma gives a list of conditions that ensure that the deformation remains a cyclic fan throughout the deformation.


\begin{lemma}\guid{}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:fan-open}
Let $\varphi$ be a deformation of a generic cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$ over an interval $I$.
Assume that $0\in I$ and that $\varphi(\v,0)=\v$ for all $\v\in V$.
For all $\v\in V$ assume that if $\{\orz,\rho^{-1}\v,\v,\rho\v\}$ is coplanar, then 
$$\{\orz,\varphi(\rho^{-1}\v,t),\varphi(\v,t),\varphi(\rho \v,t)\}$$
is coplanar for all sufficiently small $t$. 
Then there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $(V(t),E(t),F(t))$
is a generic cyclic fan for all $t\in I\cap \leftopen-\epsilon,\epsilon\rightopen$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Each of the properties of a generic cyclic fan will be examined in turn.

\case{V}:  The set $V(t)$ is the image of $V$ and is therefore finite and nonempty.  \case{origin} Since $\varphi$ is continuous and $\orz\not\in V$, it follows that $\orz\not\in V(t)$ for sufficiently small $t$.

\case{independence}: If $\v,\w$ are independent, then $\v(t)$ and $\w(t)$ are indepedent for sufficiently small $t$.

\case{intersection}: If $\ee \cap \ee'=\emptyset$, then $C(\ee)\cap S^2$ has a positive distance from $C(\ee')\cap S^2$.  Hence for sufficiently small times, the deformation of these sets remain disjoint.
If $\ee=\{\u,\v\}$ and $\ee'=\{\v,\w\}$ where $\u\ne\w$, then again the deformations of $C(\ee)\cap C(\ee')$ is $C(\{\v(t)\})$ for sufficiently small $t$.  The other cases are similar.

\case{face},~\case{cyclic hypermap}:  The azimuth order on $E(\v(t))$ is preserved; hence the combinatorial properties of the hypermap do not change when $t$ is sufficiently small.

\case{angle}: If $\op{azim}(x)<\pi$, then the inequality remains strict for sufficiently small $t$.  If $\op{azim}(x)=\pi$, then the coplanarity assumption of the lemma forces the equality to be preserved for all sufficiently small $t$.

\case{wedge}: The property $\u\in \Wdart(x)$ is an open condition.  It holds for sufficiently small $t$. Consider the case $\u\in \bWdart(x)\setminus \Wdart(x)$, where $x=  (\v_0,\rho\v_0)$.   Write $\v_i = \rho^i\v_0$ and pick $r\le k-1$ such that $\u = \v_r$.  The wedge property holds trivially when $r\in\{0,1,k-1\}$. Assume that $r\not\in\{0,1,k-1\}$. 
By the genericity assumption $\v_r$ and $\v_0$ are independent.  In the notation of Lemma~\ref{lemma:monotone},
$\beta(r) = 0$ or $\beta(r) = \beta(k-1)$.  This proof treats the case $\beta(r)=0$. (The case $\beta(r)=\beta(k-1)$ is similar.)   By Lemma~\ref{lemma:monotone}, 
$$0=\beta(1)=\beta(2)=\cdots=\beta(r),$$
and 
$$
\{\orz,\v_0,\v_1,\ldots,\v_r\} \subset \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_0\},\v_1).
$$
In particular, the set is coplanar.   By the coplanarity assumption of the lemma,  $\{\orz,\v_0(t),\v_1(t),\ldots,\v_r(t)\}$ is coplanar for
sufficiently small $t$.  In fact, the condition $\v_r(t)\not\in \op{aff}_+(\{\orz,\v_0(t)\})$ is an open condition, so that $\v_r(t)\in \op{aff}^0_+(\{\orz,\v_0(t)\},\v_1(t))$ for sufficiently small $t$.  This half-plane is the bounding half-plane of $\bWdart(F,\v_0(t))$.  Hence $\u = \v_r\in \bWdart(F,\v_0(t))$ for sufficiently small $t$.

\case{generic}: Genericity is stated as open conditions $\v\not\in C\{\u,\w\}$.  These conditions continue to hold for sufficiently small $t$.

\section{Perimeter}

%\subsection{perimeter}

\begin{definition}[perimeter]\label{lemma:perim}
Let $(V,E,F)$ be a cyclic fan.    Set
$$
\op{per}(V,E,F) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \arc_V(\orz,\{\rho^i \v,\rho^{i+1} \v\}), 
$$
where  $k=\card(F)$.
This is easily seen to be independent of the choice of $\v\in V$.  Call $\op{per}$ the perimeter of the cyclic fan.
If $\v,\w\in V$ are distinct vertices, define the partial perimeter 
$$
\op{per}(V,E,F,\v,\w) = \sum_{i=0}^{r-1} \arc_V(\orz,\{\rho^i \v,\rho^{i+1} \v\}), 
$$
where $r$ is chosen so that $\w=\rho^r \v$ and $0<r\le k-1$.
\end{definition}
\indy{Index}{perimeter!cyclic fan}%
\indy{Index}{fan!cyclic}%
\indy{Notation}{per@$\op{per}$ (perimeter)}%



\begin{lemma}\guid{WSEWPCH}\tlabel{lemma:convex-hyp}\rating{400}
 The perimeter of every cyclic fan is at most $2\pi$.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{fan!cyclic}%
\indy{Index}{perimeter}%

\begin{proof} 
\claim{If the cyclic fan is circular, then its  perimeter is $\op{per}(V,E,F) =2\pi$.}
Indeed, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:circular}, 
the arcs making up the perimeter all lie in a common plane.   
The azimuth cycle on $V$ coincides with $\rho:V\to V$.
The sum of the terms in the formula defining the perimeter is the sum of the azimuth angles in the azimuth cycle.  The sum is $2\pi$ by Lemma~\ref{lemma:2pi-sum}.


\claim{if the cyclic fan is lunar, then its  perimeter is $\op{per}(V,E,F) =2\pi$.}
Indeed, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:lunar}, the set $V$ is contained in the union of two half-planes.
The perimeter is the sum of arcs in a half-circle in the first half-plane plus
the sum of arcs in a half-circle in the second half-plane. This sum is $2\pi$.

Finally, assume that the cyclic fan is generic.
Suppose for a contradiction that the lemma is false.  Consider all counterexamples
that minimize the cardinality of $V$.  Among all such counterexamples, pick a counterexample with the smallest number of darts $x\in D$ such that $\op{azim}(x) = \pi$.

A cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$ is determined by $V$ and the cyclic permutation $\rho:V\to V$:  $E=\{\{\v,\rho \v\}\mid \v\in V\}$ and $F = \{(\v,\rho \v)\mid \v\in V\}$.

In this particular counterexample, if there is any dart $x=(\v,\w)\in F$ with $\op{azim}(x)=\pi$, then there is a new cyclic fan $(V',E',F')$ with $V' = V\setminus\{\v\}$ and $\rho':V'\to V'$ given by 
$$
\rho'(\u) = \begin{cases}
\rho(\u), & \text{if } \rho(\u)\ne \v;\\
\rho(\v), & \text{if }\rho(\u) = \v.\\
\end{cases}
$$
This is a cyclic fan with the same perimeter, contrary to the presumed minimality of the counterexample.  Thus $\op{azim}(x) <\pi$, for all $x\in F$.

If $\card(V) <3$, then the cyclic fan is circular or lunar, which has aleady been treated.  If $\card(V)=3$, then $V=\{\v_1,\v_2,\v_3\}$.  By the triangle inequality $\arc_V(\orz,\{\v_2,\v_3\}) \le \arc_V(\orz,\{\v_2,-\v_1\})+\arc_V(\orz,\{-\v_1,\v_3\})$.  Thus,
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\op{per} &=\arc_V(\orz,\{\v_1,\v_2\}) + \arc_V(\orz,\{\v_2,\v_3\}) + \arc_V(\orz,\{\v_1,\v_3\})\\
&\le(\arc_V(\orz,\{\v_1,\v_2\})+\arc(\orz,\{\v_2,-\v_1\}))+(\arc_V(\orz,\{\v_1,\v_3\})+\arc_V(\orz,\{-\v_1,\v_3\})) \\
   &= \pi+\pi.
\end{array}
$$

Now assume that $\card(V)\ge 4$.  Select $\v\in V$.  Consider a deformation of the cyclic fan $\varphi:V\times I \to \ring{R}^3$ that fixes $V\setminus\{\v\}$, and gives motion to $\v$:
$$
\varphi(\v,t) = \cos(t) \v - \sin(t) \rho \v.
$$
This is increasing in the perimeter.    For sufficiently small $t$,  it remains a generic cyclic fan (Lemma~\ref{lemma:fan-open}).  For sufficiently small $t$, the minimality gives $\angle(\varphi(u,t))<\pi$.
Eventually, for some smallest $t=t_0$ the deformation is no longer a generic cyclic fan,  or for some $\u\in V$,  $\angle(\varphi(\u,t_0))=\pi$.  In the latter  case,  the minimality condition fails, and the result follows.  



\claim{At time $t=t_0$, the deformation is a cyclic fan.}
Otherwise, if the deformation fails to be a fan at time $t=t_0$, then the \case{independence} property,  \case{intersection} property, or the \case{cyclic} property fails.  

\claim{The \case{independence} property holds}.  Indeed, the plane through $\{\orz,\v,\rho\v\}$ meets the plane through $\{\orz,\rho^{-2}\v,\rho^{-1}\v\}$ along a line through the origin.  Let $\varphi(\v,t_1)\ne\orz$ lie on that line, for some $t_1>0$.  At this point,
the deformation stops, because $\angle(\varphi(\rho^{-1}\v,t_1))=\pi$.  So $t_0\le t_1$.
However, when $t\le t_1$, the angle at $\orz$ between $\rho\v$ and $\phi(\v,t)$ is less than $\pi$, and the angle between $\rho^{-1}\v$ and $\phi(\v,t)$ is also less than $\pi$.  This gives independence.

\claim{The \case{intersection} property holds.}  If $\ee\subset V$, write $\ee(t) = \{\varphi(\u,t) \mid \u\in \ee\}$.   Let $W =W(\orz,\v,\rho\v,\rho^{-1}\v)$. The verification of the intersection property is based on the following facts (when $t>0$):
\begin{itemize} 
\item If $\v\not\in \ee$, then $C(\ee(t))=C(\ee)\subset W$.
\item $C^0\{\v(t)\} \cap W = \emptyset$.
\item $C^0\{\v(t),\rho^{-1}\v\}\cap W = \emptyset$.
\item $C\{\v(t),\rho\v\}\cap W = C\{\v,\rho\v\}.$
\item $C\{\v(t),\rho\v\}\cap C\{\v(t),\rho^{-1}\v\} = C\{\v(t)\}$.
\end{itemize}

\claim{The fan is  cyclic at $t=t_0$}.  Indeed,  the conditions for a fan to be cyclic are closed conditions.  This proves the claim that the deformation is a cyclic fan at $t=t_0$.

At $t=t_0$, the deformation is a cyclic fan that is not generic.   The perimeter bound follows  from previous cases.
\end{proof}

Here is a second proof of the same lemma.  It is conceptually much simpler, but more difficult to formalize.  It is based on polar polygons (a generalization of polar triangles to spherical polygons).

\begin{proof} A fan does not have any faces of cardinality less than three.
Every blade of the fan has radian measure less than $\pi$.  
\indy{Index}{polygon!polar}%

Consider the case of a spherical triangle.  If the edges of the
the triangle are $a_i$ and the angles of the polar
triangle are $\beta_i$, then $\beta_i=\pi-a_i$.
The the perimeter is 
$$a_1+a_2+a_3 = 2\pi - (\beta_1 -\beta_2 - \beta_3-\pi)= 2\pi-\op{sol} < 2\pi,$$
because the solid angle $\op{sol}$ of the polar triangle is always strictly positive.
\indy{Index}{triangle!spherical}%

Similarly, if the edges of the spherical polygon are
$a_i$, then the angles of the polar polygon are $\beta_i = \pi-a_i$.
The perimeter is
$$
a_1+\cdots+a_n  = 2\pi- \op{sol}< 2\pi,
$$
where $\op{sol} = 2\pi-\sum a_i$ is the solid angle of the polar polygon.

\indy{Index}{cyclic order}%

(To say that a sequence $\v_i$ of elements is in {\it cyclic order} means that
$\v_i = \rho^{j (i)}\v_0$, for some increasing function $j$ with range $\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$.)

\begin{proof}  Abbreviate $C^0 = C^0\{\v,\w\}$.  The first case to consider is $\v(x)=\v$.  For all $\p\in C^0\cap \bWdart(x)$, 
$$
0 \le \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho \v,\p) \le \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho \v,\rho^{-1} \v).
$$  
These inequalities are in fact strict.  If, for example $0 = \op{azim}(\orz,\v,\rho \v,\p)$, then
the set $\{\orz,\v,\rho \v,\w\}$ is coplanar.  Repeated application of Lemma~\ref{lemma:A} gives
$$
\angle(\v) = \angle(\rho \v) = \cdots = \angle(\rho^{-1} \w) = \pi,
$$
which is contrary to $\angle(\v') = \pi$.  
The strict inequalities imply $\p\in \Wdart(x)$ as desired.  The case $\v(x)=\w$ is similar.

Now assume that $\u=\v(x)\ne \v,\w$.  
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:A},  one may assume that $\{\orz,\u,\v,\w\}$ is not coplanar. 
(Otherwise, the contradiction $\angle(\v')=\pi$ or $\angle(\w')=\pi$ is reached.) Then
$$
\op{aff}\{\orz,\u,\v\}\cap C^0 \subset \op{aff}\{\orz,\u,\v\}\cap \op{aff}\{\orz,\v,\w\} \cap C^0 = \op{aff}\{\orz,\v\} \cap C^0 = \emptyset.
$$
Thus, $C^0$ is disjoint from $\op{aff}\{\orz,\u,\v\}$ and is similarly disjoint from $\op{aff}\{\orz,\u,\w\}$.  

We have the following facts:
$$
\v,\w\in W(\orz,\u,\v,\w),\quad C^0\{\v,\w\} \subset W(\orz,\u,\v,\w).

Also,
$$

\begin{lemma}[slicing]\guid{EJRCFJD}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:slice}  Let $(V,E,F)$ be a cyclic fan with hypermap $H$.  Pick $\v,\w\in V$. For each $\u\in \{\v,\w\}$, assume that $\u$ is independent of all elements of $V\setminus\{\u\}$.    Assume that $C^0\{\v,\w\}\subset \Wdart(x)$ for all darts $x\in F$.  Then
\begin{itemize}
\item $(V[\v,\w],E[\v,\w],F[\v,\w])$ and $(V[\w,\v],E[\w,\v],F[\w,\v])$ are cyclic fans.  
\item Let $H[\v,\w]$ and $H[\w,\v]$ be their hypermaps, respectively.  Let $g:V\to\ring{R}$ be any function.  Then
$$
\sum_{\v\in V} g(\v)\angle(H,\v) = \sum_{\v\in V[\v,\w]}g(\v)\angle(H[\v,\w],\v) + \sum_{\v\in V[\w,\v]}g(\v)\angle(H[\w,\v],\v).
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{slice}%
\indy{Index}{fan!cyclic}%

\begin{proof} 
\claim{$(V,E')$ is a fan, where $E' = E\cup \{\{\v,\w\}\}$.}
 Indeed, except for the intersection property, all of the properties of a fan follow trivially from the fact that $(V,E)$ is a fan and
that $\v$ and $\w$ are independent.  (Note the similarity with Lemma~\ref{lemma:add-edge}.)
The intersection property also is trivial except in the case $\ee=\{\v,\w\}$ and $\ee'\setminus \ee\ne \emptyset$.  Pick $\u\in \ee'\setminus\ee$.  It follows from the node
partition of Lemma~\ref{lemma:disjoint} that
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
C(\ee) \cap C(\ee') &= (C(\v) \cap C(\ee')) \cup (C(\w)\cap C(\ee')) \\
 &= C(\{\v\}\cap \ee') \cup C(\{\w\}\cap \ee') \\
 &= C(\{\v,\w\}\cap \ee').
\end{array}
$$
The intersection property thus holds and $(V,E')$ is a fan.

It follows by Lemma~\ref{lemma:localization} that $(V[\v,\w],E[\v,\w])$ is a fan.

The second conclusion of the lemma follows from the following identities.
If $\u\ne \v,\w$ with $\u\in V[\v,\w]$, then $\u\not\in V[\w,\v]$ and 
\begin{equation}
\Wdart(H,\u)=\Wdart(H[\v,\w],\u),\quad \angle(H,\u) = \angle(H[\v,\w],\u).
\end{equation}
If $\u\in\{\v,\w\}$, then 
$\angle(H,\u)=\angle(H[\v,\w],\u) +\angle(H[\w,\v],\u)$.

Finally, it remains to be seen that the fan is cyclic.  Lemma~\ref{lemma:localization} already shows that the hypermap is isomorphic to $H_{2k}$. and that $F[\v,\w]$ can be identified with a face.  The condition $V[\v,\w]\subset \bWdart(x)$ follows from the fact that the angles $\beta(i)$ are increasing in Lemma~\ref{lemma:monotone}.
\end{proof}





Section~\ref{sec:types} describes a procedure called slicing that starts with a cyclic fan $(V,E,F)$
and a blade $C^0\{\v,\w\} \subset \Wdart(x)$ for all $x$ for some $\v,\w\in V$.  The procedure slices the fan $(V,E,F)$ along $\{\v,\w\}$  into two cyclic fans:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
(V',E',F')&=(V[\v,\w],E[\v,\w],F[\v,\w]),\quad\text{and}\\
 (V'',E'',F'')&= (V[\w,\v],E[\w,\v],F[\w,\v]).
\end{array}
$$



The slicing procedure can also be applied to a special fan $(V,E,F,G)$.
Both edge sets $E'$ and $E''$ contain $\{\v,\w\}$.  The sets $G'$ and $G''$ can be defined
as 
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
G' &= \{\{\v,\w\}\} \cup (E'\cap G).\\
G'' &= \{\{\v,\w\}\} \cup (E''\cap G).\\
\end{array}
$$ 

Let $(r',s')$ and $(r'',s'')$ be the parameters for $(V',E',F',G')$ and $(V'',E'',F'',G'')$, respectively.
Set $k=r+s$, $k'=r'+s'$, and $k''=r''+s''$.

\begin{lemma}\guid{IXZYRSY}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:param-add}  
Let $(V,E,F,G)$ be a special fan (with parameters $s,r$).  
Pick distinct elements $\v,\w\in V$  such that $\{\v,\w\}\not\in E$.
Assume that $\norm{\v}{\w}=2\hm$.
For each $\u\in \{\v,\w\}$, assume that $\u$ is independent of all elements of $V\setminus\{\u\}$.    
%Assume that $C^0\{\v,\w\}\subset \Wdart(x)$ for all darts $x\in F$. 
Then $(V',E',F',G')$ is a special fan.  Moreover,
the parameters satisfy the relations
$$
k'+k'' = k + 2,\quad s'+s'' = s + 2,\quad r'+r''=r.
$$
Finally,
$$
\tau(V,E,F)= \tau(V'',E'',F'') +\tau(V',E',F').
$$
\end{lemma}

By interchanging $\v$ and $\w$, the lemma also asserts that $(V'',E'',F'',G'')$ is a special fan.

\begin{proof}  Each of the defining properties of a special fan will be considered in turn.  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:2hm-slice}, if $\{v,w\}\not\in E$, then $C^0\{v,w\}\subset \Wdart(x)$ for all darts $x\in F$.

The properties \case{packing}, \case{annulus}, \case{diagonal}, \case{subset}, \case{g norm}, and \case{e norm} follow directly from definitions and the corresonding properties for $(V,E,F,G)$.
The property \case{cyclic fan} follows from Lemma~\ref{lemma:slice}.

The relations between the constants $k,s,r$ for the various fans follows directly from the construction.
For example, there are two darts more in $F''\cup F'$ than in $F$.  

\claim{Property~\case{card} holds.}  Indeed, recall that each face in the hypermap of a fan has at least three darts.  Hence $3\le k$, $3\le k'$, and $3\le k''$.
The sets $G'$ and $G''$ contain $\{\v,\w\}$.  Hence $1\le s'$ and $1\le s''$.
From $0\le r\le 6 - 2s$, it follows that $s\le 3$.  If $s=3$, then $r=0$, and $k=r+s=3$.  This means that $F$ is a triangle.  For some ordering of the pair, $x=(\v,\w)$ is a dart in $F$.
Hence  $C^0\{\v,\w\} \not\subset \Wdart(x)$.  This is contrary to hypothesis.  Therefore, $s\le 2$.

Now for the verifications.
$$0\le s' = s + 2 - s'' \le s+1\le 3.$$
$$3-s'\le k'-s' = r'.$$
$$k' = k + 2 - k'' \le k-1.$$
$$
r'= k'+s' - 2 s' \le (k-1) + (s+1) - 2s' =k+s - 2s' = r + 2s -2s' \le 6 - 2s'.
$$
This completes the proof of property~\case{card}.

The additivity of $\tau$ follows directly from the azimuth angle estimates in Lemma~\ref{lemma:slice}.
\end{proof}


\section{Minimality}

%\subsection{minimality}


\begin{definition}[minimal~fan,~$k_{min}$,~$\tau_{min}$]
Let $k_{min}$ be the minimum of $r+s$ over
all special fans $(V,E,F,G)$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kmin}
\tau(V,E,F) < d (r,s),
\end{equation}
where $(r,s)$ are the parameters of the special fan.
If no special fan exists that satisfies the inequality, then set $k_{min}=0$.
Let $\tau_{min}$ be the infimum of $\tau(V,E,F)$ over all special fans
$(V,E,F,G)$ whose parameters $(r,s)$ satisfy $r+s=k_{min}$.  If no special fans
exist with parameters $r+s=k_{min}$, then set $\tau_{min}=0$.
Any special fan $(V,E,F,G)$ with parameter $r+s=k_{min}$ such that
$$
\tau_{min}= \tau(V,E,F)
$$
is a {\it minimal}  fan.
\end{definition}

%\begin{lemma}\guid{UJRPOEP}\rating{ZZ}
%The set of minimal fans is compact.
%\end{lemma}

%\begin{proof}  It is a closed subset
%$$
%\{(V,E,F,G)\in {\mathcal S} \mid \tau(V,E,F,G)=\tau_{min} \text{ and }
%   r+s = k_{min}\}
%$$ 
% of the compact space of special fans.
%\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}\guid{ADKOXQY}\rating{ZZ}
There is a constant $c>2\hm$ such that for every minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$
and every distinct $\v,\w\in V$, either $\{\v,\w\}\in E$ or $\norm{\v}{\w}\ge c$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The function
$$
\min_{\v\ne \w\in V,~~\{\v,\w\}\not\in E} \norm{\v}{\w}
$$
is a continuous function on the compact set of minimal fans.
It attains a minimum $c$ for some minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$.  By the property~\case{diagonal} of special fans, $c\ge 2\hm$.

Suppose for a contradiction that $c=2\hm$.  Then $\norm{\v}{\w}=2\hm$ for
some $\{\v,\w\}\not\in E$.  Then by Lemma~\ref{lemma:2hm-slice}, $C^0\{\v,\w\}\subset \Wdart(x)$, for all $x\in F$.
The fan can be split along the $\{\v,\w\}$.  
The parameters for the new pieces satisfy:
$$
k' = k+2 - k'' \le k-1.
$$
The function $d$ is additive across the split:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:drs}
\begin{array}{lll}
d(r',s') + d(r',s') &= d_1 (2-s') + d_2 (r'+2 s'-4) + d_1 (2-s'') + d_2 (r''+2s''-4)\\
   & d_1 (2 - s) + d_2 (r + 2 s) \\
   & d(r,s).
\end{array}
\end{equation}
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:param-add}, one of the two resulting fans satisfies inequality~\ref{eqn:kmin}.  This is contrary to the choice of $k_{min}$ in the definition of minimality.
\end{proof}





\subsection{genericity}

\begin{lemma}\guid{RRAJQBH}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:circular-nonmin}
Every minimal fan is generic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By the classification of cyclic fans, it is enough to show that the fan is not circular and not lunar.

\claim{A minimal fan is not circular.}  Indeed,
if the special fan $(V,E,F)$ is circular, then $\op{azim}(x) =\pi$ for all $x\in F$.
The result follows from the following estimates:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\tau(V,E,F) &=\sum_{x\in F} \op{azim}(x)\left(1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}  \dfrac{\normo{v}-2}{2\hm-2}\right) + \left(\pi+{\sol_0}\right) (2- k(F))\\
 &\ge \sum_{x\in F} \pi + \left(\pi+{\sol_0}\right) (2- k(F))\\
 &= 2\pi + 2\sol_0 - k(F) \sol_0\\
 &\ge 2\pi - 4\sol_0\\
&> 0.7578\\
&=0.103 (2) + 0.2759 (2)\\
&\ge 0.103 (2-s) + 0.2759 (r+2s-4) \\ 
&= d(r,s)\\
%\sol(U_F) \left( 1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}\right) - \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi} \sum_{x\in F} \op{azim}(x)(L(h(x)))\\
%&= 2\pi \left( 1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}\right) - \sol_0 \sum_{x\in F} L(h(x))\\
%&\ge 2\pi \left( 1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}\right) - 6 \sol_0\\
\end{array}
$$
Thus, $\tau(V,E,F)\ge d(r,s)$, for every circular special fan $(V,E,F,G)$.  This implies the result.

Section~\ref{sec:deformation} develops a theory of deformations of cyclic fans $(V,E,F)$.  Recall that a deformation is  continuous function $\varphi:V\times I\to\ring{R}^3$.  A deformation determines sets $V(t)$, $E(t)$, $F(t)$, and $G(t)$ for each $t\in I$.

%\begin{lemma}\guid{EBXEISF}\rating{ZZ}
%Every minimal fan is generic.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}  There are no circular special fans by Lemma~\ref{lemma:circular-nonmin}.

\claim{A minimal fan is not lunar.}  Otherwise,
suppose for a contradiction, that $(V,E,F)$ is lunar, special, and
minimal.  Let $\v,\w\in V$ be dependent.   Example~\ref{example:lunar} describes a deformation of the lunar fan $(V,E,F)$
over $I=\leftclosed0,1\rightopen$.  The deformation fixes $\normo{\u}$
and is non-increasing in $\angle(\u(t))$, for $\u\in V$.
From the defining formula for $\tau$, it follows that the function $\tau(V(t),E(t),F(t))$ is a decreasing function of $t$.

For sufficiently small positive $t$, the deformation is a special fan. XX continue.

As $t\in I$ increases, $\angle(\v(t))$ is tending to zero and the distance
$$
\norm{ \varphi(\rho \v,t)}{\varphi(\rho^{-1} \v,t)}
$$
is decreasing.
For sufficiently large $t\in I$, 
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:0.852} implies that this is no longer a special fan.

Pick the largest $a$ for which the property~\case{diagonal XX} holds on
$\leftclosed0,a\rightclosed$.
By Lemma~\ref{XX}, the special fan $(V(a),E(a),F(a),G(a))$ can be split.
This is contrary to minimality.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{}\rating{}
Every minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$ is irreducible at every $\v\in V$.
\end{lemma}

The proof appears in the next subsection as a series of small verifications.

\subsection{features}

 If there are $i$ consecutive flat vertices $\v_1,\ldots,\v_i$, then there are  $i+2$ corresponding vertices that lie in a plane $A$ through the origin: $\{\v_0,\ldots,\v_{i+1}\}\subset A$.


\begin{lemma}\guid{TESVAFW}
Every minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$ satisfies property \case{no triple flat} of irreducibility at every $\v\in V$.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Three flat vertices produces an arc

\arc_V(0,\{\v_0,\v_4\}) = \op{per}(V,E,F,\v_0,\v_4) \ge4\arc(2\hm,2\hm,2) > \pi,

\begin{lemma}\guid{SDCCMGA}\rating{ZZ}
Every minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$ satisfies property \case{g flat} of irreducibility at every $\v\in V$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Argue by contradiction.  From the constraints on $r$ and $s$, if $s>0$, then $r+s\le 5$. 

If $r+s\le 4$, then a plane $A$ contains the origin and $V = \{\rho^{-1}\v,\v,\rho \v,\rho^2v\}$.  This is not generic.

Thus, $r+s=5$, forming a triangle with a linear series of three, and the two other edges.  If $y=\normo{\rho^{-1} \v}$, then the partial perimeter from $\rho^{-1}\v$ to $\rho^2 \v$ is as least
$$
\arc(y,2\hm,2)+\arc(2\hm,2\hm,2) +\arc(2\hm,2\hm,2\hm)
$$
which is greater than the maximum sum of the other two lengths:
$$
\arc(y,2,2\hm)+\arc(2,2,2\hm).
$$
This violates the triangle inequality.

Let $A$ be the plane containing $\{\orz,\rho^{-1}\v,\v,\rho\v\}$.  Assume that $\{u,v\}\in E\setminus G$.  Let $\u\ne \w\in E(\v)$.  Then $\u,\v,\w\in A$. 

If the conclusion is false, then for sufficiently small positive $a$, let $\varphi$ be the  deformation over $[0,a]$ that fixes all elements of $V$ other than $\v$ and moves $\v$ in the plane $A$ around the circle of radius $\norm{\w}{\v}$ with center $\w$.  It decreases $\tau$.  It is a deformation of special fans.  This shows that $(V,E,F,G)$ is not minimal.

\begin{lemma}\guid{CFJSRQH}  Every minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$ has property \case{flat middle} at every $\v\in V$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Write $\v_i = \rho^{i-2} \v$.  By previous results, none of the edges $\{\v_0,\v_1\}$, $\{\v_1,\v_2\}$, $\{\v_2,\v_3\}$ lie in $G$.  Furthermore, the distances $\norm{\v_i}{\v_{i+1}}$ are equal to one another and take values in $\{2,2\hm\}$, for $i=0,1,2$.  
If these distances are $2\hm$, then the partial perimeter from $\v_1$ to $\v_4$ is at least
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:3side}
\arc(y_1,2,2\hm)+\arc(2,2,2\hm)+\arc(2,y_4,2\hm),
\end{equation}
where $\normo{\v_i}=y_i$.
However, there are at most two other vertices and three other edges in the special fan.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of these three lengths is at most \eqn{eqn:3side}.
Thus, equality is obtained in the triangle inequality, and the polygon reduces to a linear segment.  This is not generic.

\indy{Index}{maximal height}%
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume there are two adjacent flat angles $\v_2,\v_3$, forming a linear series $\v_1,\v_2,\v_3,\v_4$.
By previously established properties of irreducibility,
\indy{Index}{angle!flat}%
$\norm{\v_i}{\v_{i+1}}=2$, for $i=1,2,3$.
Let $y_i = \normo{\v_i}$.
Pull one vertex $\v_2$ away from $\orz$ and push the other $\v_3$ in such a way that fixes $y_2+y_3$, while decreasing the arclength of the linear series.  This follows by concavity.
In fact, the arclength is given by a sum of three terms:
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^3\arc(y_i,y_{i+1},2).
  $$
This follows from a calculation showing that the second derivative of $\arc(t,s,2)$ with respect to $t$ is negative, for $t,s\in[2,2\hm]$.  Thus, the
sum is also concave, so that arclength is decreased as much as possible when the heights are extremal.

As a function of $\normo{\v}$
 $\tau$ has negative second derivative whenever the derivative is zero.  Thus, $\tau$ has no local minimum.

The proof is an interval arithmetic calculation over a five-dimensional space~\cite[cc:d2b]{hales:2009:nonlinear}. %%cc:d2b
\end{proof}


%Thus, if there a sequence of a flat vertex $\u$, an acute vertex $\v$, and another acute vertex, then  assume that $\u$ or $\v$ has extremal height $\in\{2,2\hm\}$.



\begin{lemma}\guid{CMBZAOZ}\rating{ZZ}
Every minimal fan $(V,E,F,G)$ satisfies property \case{flat exists} of irreducibility for every $\v\in V$.
That is, if none of $\v,\rho \v,\rho^2 \v,\rho^3 \v\in V$ is flat, and if $r+s\ge 4$,
then $r+s=4$, and $\norm{\v}{\w}= 2$, for all $\{\v,\w\}\in E$.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Notation}{ZZtau@$\tau$}%

\begin{proof} 
Suppose that there are four consecutive vertices $\v_1,\v_2,\v_3,\v_4$ that are not flat, and consider the chain of four consecutive vertices $\v_1,\v_2,\v_3,\v_4$. By Lexell arguments, each edge $\norm{\v_i}{\v_{i+1}}$ is $2$ or $2\hm$. Set $y_i = \normo{\v_i}$ and $y_{ij} = \norm{\v_i}{\v_j}$. After adjusting heights $y_i$ is $2$ or $2\hm$, for $i=2,3$. This leaves four degrees of freedom:
$$
y_1,y_4,y_{14},
$$
and a diagonal to the quadrilateral, say $y_{13}$. Assume without loss of generality that  $y_{14}\ge 2\hm$.  (If it is smaller, it is an uncut edge of the polygonal, of length $2$, so that the polygon is actually a convex quadrilateral.  This special case is most easily dealt with separately.)

In this context, the function $\tau$ as a function of $y_1,y_4,y_{14},y_{13}$ does not have an interior point local minimum.
This is an interval arithmetic calculation~\cite[cc:qua]{hales:2009:nonlinear} in four variables.%% cc:quad tau-estimate, deform a quadrilateral.
\end{proof}

%As a consequence, the minimum occurs when a new flat vertex forms.   Then eliminate any case with four consecutive vertices that are not flat (after treating the quadrilateral with four edges $y_{ij}=2$ as a special case).

\subsection{emptiness}

\begin{lemma}\guid{LPQUDGF}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:min-empty}  
The set of minimal fans is empty.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
More than one of these can be combined in a single polygon.   Represent the sizes of the linear series in a polygon with $k$ sides as a partition of $k$.
The number of parts of the partition gives the number of sides of the polygon when each linear series is considered a single side. 
\indy{Index}{linear!series}%

Let us review the combinatorial possibilities.  In each case,  check that the inequality holds, to complete the proof of the main estimate.  Label each 
case by the partition.  If the partition is $(\mu_1,\mu_2,\ldots)$, 
index the vertices in the same order as the partition, with $\v_0$
the vertex occurring just before the first flat vertex.  For example,
if the partition is $(3,1,1)$, the polygon is a pentagon, flattened into
an effective triangle, with vertices $\v_0,\ldots,\v_4$, where $\v_1$ and $\v_2$
are the flat vertices.
\indy{Notation}{ZZmu@$\mu$ (partition)}%

The following constraints hold on the partition: it is
a partition of $k$, where $3\le k\le 6$; there
are at least three parts; the largest part is at most $3$;  there are
at most two consecutive parts that equal $1$, unless it is a special triangular case $(1,1,1)$ or
quadrilateral case $(1,1,1,1)$, discussed below.  In only one case
does the order of the parts matter: $(2,1,2,1)$ versus $(2,2,1,1)$.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf (1,1,1)}  This is a triangle.  There are three degrees of
freedom $y_i$.  Since this is arising from a polygon that was not originally a triangle,  assume that for at least one of the edges: $y_{ij}=2\hm$.
\item {\bf (1,1,1,1)}  This is a convex quadrilateral with four sides $y_{ij}=2$ and four extremal heights $y_i$.  There is one degree of freedom given by the diagonal.
\item {\bf (2,1,1)} This is a quadrilateral, flattened into an effective triangle.  There are two degrees of freedom: one of the three variables $y_0,y_1,y_2$ is extremal.  All of the other variables are extremal.
\item {\bf (3,1,1)}  This is a pentagon, flattened into an effective triangle.  There are three degrees of freedom $y_0,y_{03},y_3$ along the flattened side, and no freedom in the rest of the figure.  It follows that $y_{01}=y_{12}=y_{23}=2$.
\item {\bf (2,2,1)} This is a pentagon, flattened into an effective triangle.  The edge lengths $y_{i,i+1}$ are all extremal.  Because of height adjustments, there are three degrees of freedom in the heights $y_i$.
\item {\bf (3,2,1)} This is a hexagon, flattened into an effective triangle.  There are four degrees of freedom.
\item {\bf (2,2,2)}  This is a hexagon, flattened into an effective triangle.  There are six degrees of freedom, given by all heights $y_i$.
\item {\bf (2,1,2,1)} This is a hexagon, flattened into an effective quadrilateral.  There are five degrees of freedom: a diagonal $y_{03}$ to the quadrilateral and four independent heights.
\item {\bf (2,2,1,1)}  This is a hexagon, flattened into an effective quadrilateral.  There are four degrees of freedom: a diagonal $y_{03}$ to the quadrilateral and three independent heights.

Interval arithmetic calculations~\cite[cc:tau]{hales:2009:nonlinear} %% cc:par partition cases for tau[r,s]. 
for each of these cases completes the proof.  The set of minimal fans is empty.  ``Praise to the emptiness that blanks out existence.'' -- Rumi % The essential Rumi page 21.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\guid{JEJTVGB}\rating{ZZ}\label{lemma:empty-d}
$$
\tau(V,E,F) \ge d (r,s)
$$
for every special fan $(V,E,F,G)$, where $(r,s)$ are the parameters of $(V,E,F,G)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof} 
The function $(\v,I)\mapsto \tau(V(\v),E(\v),F(\v),G(\v,I)$ is continuous of the space of fan data.

Assume the negation of the conclusion.  
Then $k_{min}>0$, because it is the cardinality of some nonempty set $V$.
There exists a sequence of fan data $(\v_i,I_i)$ such that 
$\tau(V(\v_i),E(\v_i),F(\v_i))$ tends to $\tau_{min}$.  By passing to a subsequence in the compact 
metric space of fan data, the sequence $(\v_i,I_i)$ converges to some fan datum $(\v,I)$.
It follows that $\tau_{min} = \tau(V,E,F)$, where $(V,E,F,G)=(V(\v),E(\v),F(\v),G(\v,I))$.   
This is a minimal fan.
However, the set of minimal fans is empty.
