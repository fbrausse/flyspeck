\chapter{Credits}\label{sec:credit}

This book is just a blueprint, which gives instructions about how to
construct a formal proof.  The actual construction of the edifice is a
large team effort.  My contributions have been a small fraction of the
whole.

The parts of this book that cover the text portions of the proof of
the Kepler conjecture have been formally verified in the proof
assistant HOL Light.\footnote{These formal verifications are part of
  the Flyspeck project, which has the eventual aim to give a formal
  verification of the computer portions of the proof as
  well. Substantial progress has been made on the formal verification
  of the computer portions of the proof.} 
To the best of my knowledge, this book is the first research monograph in mathematics
that has formally verified the results of the research
prior to publication.\footnote{XX.  As of July 2011, there are about
  500 lines of text from the book that remain to be formally verified.
  This formalization will be completed prior to publication.}
\footnote{ Here is the fine print.  This book has been fully
  formalized, except for the following explicit omissions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The formalized text does not include the parts of the text (such
  as remarks, introductory passages, and auxiliary results) that are
  not strictly a part of the proof of the Kepler conjecture.
\item It does not include the parts of the Kepler conjecture that lie
  outside the text. That is, it does not include the computer portions
  of the proof (tame graph classification, linear programming, and
  nonlinear inequality verification).
\item Also excluded are three specific sections of the text that describe
  the relationship between the text and the computer portions of
  the proof: Section~\ref{sec:hypermap-algorithm}, Section~\ref{sec:weight}, and Section~\ref{sec:tsp},
\end{itemize}
}
 The formal verifications
have been made over a period of years by a number of formal-proof
experts.  This appendix cites their contributions. The principal
formalizer of each chapter is indicated with an asterisk.
