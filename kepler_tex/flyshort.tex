  \begin{abstract} These are unpublished appendices for  "Dense Sphere Packings" (DSP). These are notes that were useful in the formalization of some lemmas in the proof of the Kepler conjecture but were considered too technical for inclusion in DSP. It also includes material related to some changes that were made to  the formalization that occurred after the publication of DSP.  These appendices have not been edited into a form that is suitable   for publication. They were primarily written for the benefit  of the members of the Flyspeck team who carried out the formalization.
