This book is just a blueprint.  It is a piece of paper that gives instructions
about how to construct a formal proof.  The actual construction of the edifice
has been a large team effort.  My contributions have been a tiny fraction of the whole.

I am grateful to Sam Ferguson, for the years that
he spent working on this problem with me.  I also thank the early editors
R. MacPherson, G. Fejes T\'oth, and J. Lagarias for the many improvements
they brought to the original proof.

Many colleagues in the formal theorem proving community have helped me
to learn the theory and the tools.  Many others have worked tirelessly
 to make the Flyspeck formalization project a reality.  I wish to thank

 I thank John Harrison for designing and implementing the most beautiful piece of
 software I have ever encountered.  He has contributed large bodies of formal mathematics to
the libraries of the HOL Light proof assistant in order to make the Flyspeck project
possible.   Tobias Nipkow became involved in the project at an early stage and
directed the graduate work of two students on the formal verification of computer
code for the Flyspeck project. Mark Adams has taught me about how
 large-scale project should be organized, and has skillfully managed 
  Flyspeck group in Hanoi.

  When I learned that my NSF proposal had been funded, I felt
  nauseous.  I looked into what would be involved in declining the
  funding.  I was  worried sick that the  deliverables I had put
  into the proposal were far beyond my capacity.  It was one thing to
  grandstand, and quite another to implement the largest
  formalization project that had ever been attempted.  In retrospect, I
  thank NSF for its generous support of this project.  Through this
  research support, many people have contributed years of their time to move this
  project forward.  A two-month NSF-funded workshop on formal proof
  and the Flyspeck project was held at the Math Institute in Hanoi during the summer of
  2009.  This workshop and all that has grown out of it have been crucial for
  the success of this project.

The Benter Foundation has generously provided a grant to rework the original
proof along lines suggested by C. Marchal.

Much of the material from this book was covered
in a course on discrete geometry and computers at the University of
Pittsburgh, and then later %at a workshop on formal proof and the Flyspeck project 
in Hanoi.  I would like to thank the members of these
groups for assisting in the preparation of the book.

The nth draft of this book was written during a sabbatical leave from the
University of Pittsburgh.  I wish to thank the many institutions that
supported me during this period: the Max Planck Institute in Bonn, the
\'Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure, the Institute of Math in Hanoi, Radboud
Univeristy in Nijmegen, and the University of Strasbourg.  I thank
those that made the arrangements, including G. Mints, F. Loeser,
F. Lecomte, H. Barendregt, Ha Huy Khoai and Ng\^o Vi\d{\^e}t Trung.

I dedicate this book to my grandfather W. B. Hales, undergraduate
teachers N. Hawley, P. J. Cohen, and graduate advisor R. P. Langlands.
