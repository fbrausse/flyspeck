I am grateful to Sam Ferguson for the years that he spent working on
this problem with me.  I also thank the early editors Robert
MacPherson, Gabor Fejes T\'oth, and Jeff Lagarias for the many
improvements they brought to the original proof.

Many have worked tirelessly to make the Flyspeck formalization project
a reality.  I wish to thank

I would like to give particular thanks 
to John Harrison for designing and implementing the
most amazing piece of software I have ever encountered.  He has
contributed large bodies of formal mathematics to the libraries of the
HOL Light proof assistant in order to make the Flyspeck project
possible.  Tobias Nipkow became involved in the project at an early
stage and directed the graduate work of two students, Bauer and Obua,
on the formal verification of computer code for the Flyspeck
project. Mark Adams has taught me about how a large-scale project should
be organized and has skillfully managed the Flyspeck group in Hanoi.

When I learned that my NSF proposal\footnote{This research has been 
supported by the National Science Foundation
under Grants 0503447 and 0804189 as well as a grant from the Benter
Foundation.}
had been funded, I considered
turning down the funding because I worried that the deliverables I had
put into the proposal were beyond my capacity.  It was one thing to
grandstand and quite another to implement the largest formalization
project that had ever been attempted.  In retrospect, I am indebted to
NSF for its generous support of this project.  It has supported this
project in all of its aspects, including a two-month workshop on
formal proof and the Flyspeck project at the Math Institute in Hanoi
during the summer of 2009.  This workshop and all that has grown out
of it have been crucial for the success of this project.

I am also indebted to the Benter Foundation for a generous grant to
rework the original proof along lines proposed by Marchal.

Much of the material from this book was covered in a course on
discrete geometry and computers at the University of Pittsburgh and
then later in Hanoi.  I would like to thank the members of these
groups for assisting in the preparation of the book.

A draft of this book was written during a sabbatical leave from the
University of Pittsburgh, 2007--2008.  I wish to thank the many
institutions that supported me during this period: the Max Planck
Institute in Bonn, the \'Ecole Normale Sup\'erieure in Paris, the
Institute of Math in Hanoi, Radboud University in Nijmegen, and the
University of Strasbourg.  These visits would not have been possible
without the assistance of Grigori Mints, Fran\c{c}ois Loeser, Florence
Lecomte, Henk Barendregt, Ha Huy Khoai and Ngo Viet Trung.
