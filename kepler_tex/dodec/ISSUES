2) Should we have a picture of protected Voronoi regions?  Might
 make the definition of truncation more clear.

3) How's the numbering?

5) Should we use Sam's Quoin picture?

6) I'm sorry about the incorrect constant you mention on p. 29. 
It has been checked in check-7.2.6.m

7) Figure holes are not being formatted correctly.  Perhaps
having the actual figures will fix this.

8) The requests for exact references to the code were removed.
I will have an overview at the code page that refers to lemma
numbers of the paper so that it is easy for a reader to find
the relevant facts.

9) Check section 8.  I modified the description somewhat because
I removed the appendix and didn't think the resulting 
text was clear.  I'm not sure you'll agree with the changes.

10) I'd be happy to draw pictures for the places you mark them.
eg. line 1578, % XX Draw counterclockwise orientation of face.
I'm just not sure if they exist already or not, so I didn't
draw them.

11) Check lazarsfeld.txt.  This is a proposed email regarding
code hosting.
