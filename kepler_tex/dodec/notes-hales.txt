TODO:


%10^-10 footnote. Is mu(,UF) really what is wanted for triangles? Yes.
% checked up to 7.3.
% Had to change D(3,1) = 0.0155.  Check this is OK with calculations not shown.

% avoid introducing omega_S if possible.  It is not needed up through 7.3.
% DONE: remark on strict inequalities and Footnote 3 on page 25.
% Done to 7.5.6.
% Cannot find proof of property 6 of tamenes (p,q,r)...
% The order of the properties is now seriously out of parallel form!!
% In def of Voronoi weight assignment prop. 2; changed m \ge 5 to m \ge 4.
% fact sheet is strange in bib.

% MAJOR THINGS TO DO
%
% I plan to clean up the section "Basic Truncation" to give
% volume formulas in a way that the formula for mu(Lambda,U)
% is apparent.  There are several missing references ref{XX}
% to this section scattered throughout the paper.
%
% A separate function name is needed (say \mu_S) 
% for the function of six variables that represents \mu(\Lambda,U_F)
% for triangles F.
% mindlessly->mechanically


%% XX add graphics.
% Graphic of a truncated Voronoi cell
% Graphic of a single cap, double cap, triple cap (inclusion-exclusion)
% A picture of a corner cell, truncated corner cell.
% Graphic of an unstable triple (u,v,w).
% graphic of the partition of space into standard components.

%% Minor things to watch for.
% Notation H,P,A, etc. for planes and half-spaces.
% 50 page limit
% 13 should not be a standing assumption. Add it as a special assumption where needed.
% English, passives, proofread 
% term defined but not used: distinguished, 
% chi is not used in the text.  Should it be deleted from Tarski section?
% Delta is not used in the text.  Should it be deleted from Tarski section?

%% Resolved.
% spell check
% 0.178, trgt -> mu(\Lambda_{dod}).
% not used: basic, quasi-regular, admissible,
% unstable, instability
% paper -> article
% hypermap (D,e,n,f).
% t_0 -> t_{dod}
% biconnected => connected
% dih-> azim
% we -> impersonal
% translation -> reparametrization
% D-> D_dod
% # for cardinality
% regions -> components
% rename "geometrically planar" -> spherical
% rename plain -> involutive
