Dear Robert,

Thank you again for taking an interest in our paper. Attached is a
draft of our latest version. As you can see, it is under the agreed 50
page limit. The understandable page restriction lead us to some
compromises about what to include in the paper.

We feel that the purely mathematical content is covered well in the
present paper. We decided to leave out much of the technical details
such as the actual inequalities that are used to generate linear
programs, as well as any description of the computer code used to
prove such inequalities. We decided to include such details along with
the complete computer source on a publicly hosted website,

http://code.google.com/p/kepler-code/

This is an open-source project repository hosted by Google.
The other major project hosting website is Source Forge
(http://sourceforge.net/).  Both Source Forge and Google
offer about the same services, which we describe below.  

We feel that using such a project website is a good choice for the
Dodecahedral conjecture details and code for several reasons:

1) Availability

The pages are freely available to the public.  Any
Internet user can browse any document in the project hierarchy.

2) Price

This is a free service provided by Google

3) Repository

The Google project page contains a version-control source code
repository. This means that any time we made a change to the code
during development, the change is publicly acknowledged and recorded
in the repository records. The code as it existed at any date and time
can be recovered using simple commands of the embedded subversion software
(http://subversion.tigris.org/). The result is an electronic
history of the source code.

4) wiki/download area

The project page contains an area where we can put the relevant
documents regarding technical details of the proof and code.  There
is also a wiki where we can comment on the various documents in
an organized fashion.  

For these reasons we think that the current location of the code is a 
good choice for its permanent home.  

Again, thank you for your time and effort in our behalf.

Sincerely,

Tom Hales
Sean McLaughlin
