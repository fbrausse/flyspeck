\section{Hypermap Systems}

A classification of tame hypermaps has been obtained in an earlier
chapter.  The object of this chapter is to show that each is infeasible
in a sense to be made precise.  By proving infeasibility, we rule
it out as a possible counterexample to the sphere packing problem.


\begin{definition}
A hypermap system is a tuple $(H,F,\ell,\Phi)$, where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $H$ is a
hypermap, 
%\item $V$ is the vector space of real valued functions on the
%set of darts of $H$, 
\item $F$ is a finite set (called the set of flags), 
\item $\ell\ge 0$, and 
\item $\Phi$ is a set of boolean conditions on the
disjoint union, $V^\ell\cup F$ for some $\ell$, where $V$
is the vector space of real-valued functinos on the set of darts of $H$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A morphism $f:(H,F,\ell,\Phi)\to (H',F',\ell',\Phi')$
of hypermap systems is a tuple 
$f=(f_*,f_F^*,f_V^*)$, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $f_*:H\to H'$ is a covering map,
\item $f_F^*:F'\mapsto F$ is any function,
\item $f_V^*:(V')^{\ell'}\to V^\ell$ is linear, such that
\item $\Phi' \vdash (x',v')\mapsto \phi(f_F^*x',f_V^*v')$, for
all $\phi\in\Phi$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The set of all hypermap systems forms a category.
