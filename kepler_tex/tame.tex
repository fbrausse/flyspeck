\chapter{Tame Hypermap}
\indy{Index}{hypermap!tame}%

\label{sec:tame}
\indy{Index}{tame}%

\begin{summary}
  This chapter is the last of the three core chapters on the
 proof of the Kepler conjecture.  If $V$ is a finite set of
  vectors in $\ring{R}^3$, let
  \[ \CalL(V) = \sum_{\v\in V}
    L(\normo{\v}/2).\] 
Let $\BB$ be the
annulus $\bar B(\orz,2h_0)\setminus B(\orz,2)$, where
$\bar B(\orz,r)$ is the closed ball of radius $r$.
By Corollary~\ref{cor:CE},  the Kepler conjecture holds
 if every packing $V$
contained in $\BB$
satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:CCE}
\CalL(V) \le 12.
\end{equation}
\indy{Notation}{L1@$\CalL(V)$ (estimation of a packing)}%

In this chapter, we assume that there exists a counterexample $V$ to this
inequality and reach a contradiction.  A subset of extremal
counterexamples  is selected that is particularly well-suited for
further analysis.  Every extremal counterexample gives rise to a fan
and a corresponding hypermap.  A detailed study of these hypermaps
leads to a long list of properties that all such hypermaps must
possess.  A \newterm{tame} hypermap is defined by these properties.  Tameness is thus an
umbrella term that covers a long list of loosely related properties.

An earlier chapter on hypermaps gives an algorithm that generates all
restricted hypermaps with a given bound on the number of nodes.
Every tame hypermap is restricted and has at most fifteen nodes.  Hence, a
list of all tame hypermaps can be obtained by generating all
restricted hypermaps and filtering out those that are not tame.  This
algorithm has been implemented and executed in computer code.  The result
 is an explicit list that classifies tame hypermaps
up to isomorphism.  This classification solves a major step of the
packing problem.

Each tame hypermap $H$ gives rise to a nonlinear optimization problem to
maximize $\CalL(V)$ subject to the constraint that the hypermap
associated with $V$ is isomorphic to $H$.  This nonlinear optimization
problem has a relaxation in the form of a linear program with a maximum that
 is at least as large as the maximum of the nonlinear program.
Each linear program has been solved by computer.  In every case, after branching
into subcases, the 
maximum is less than $12$.  Hence, Inequality~\ref{eqn:CCE}
always holds, so that the Kepler conjecture is confirmed.

\section{Definition}

This section gives the definition of a tame hypermap, which is object of study in
this chapter.    The definition depends on a large set of parameters, which have
been determined by computer experimentation.  On the one hand, the idea is to define a class
of hypermaps that is finite and small enough to classify without much trouble.
On the other hand, we have to prove that every counterexample $V$ of \eqref{eqn:CCE}
has a hypermap that is tame.  The smaller the class of hypermaps, the more difficult
it becomes to relate them to the counterexample $V$.  In the end, we seek a balance
between these contrary demands.

function as a measure of optimality. Below, in the definition of a tame
hypermap (Definition~\ref{def:tame}), any hypermap that overshoots the

\section{Contravening Hypermap}

\subsection{standard fan}

Let $V\subset \BB$ be a packing.  Define $E_{std}=E_{std}(V)$ and $E_{ctc}=E_{ctc}(V)$
by
\formaldef{$E_{std}$}{ESTD}
\formaldef{$E_{ctc}$}{ECTC}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:fan-edge}
E_{std} &= \{\{\v,\w\}\subset V\mid 0 < \norm{\v}{\w}\le 2\hm \},\\
E_{ctc} &= \{ \{\v,\w\}\subset V\mid \norm{\v}{\w}= 2 \}\subset E_{std}.
\end{align}

\begin{lemma}[]\guid{UBHDEUU}\label{lemma:ctc-fan}
\formalauthor{Solovyev}
Let $V\subset \BB$ be a packing.  If $E=E_{std}$ or $E=E_{ctc}$, then
$(V,E)$ is a fan.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}\guid{SUZCOOW}
The fans $(V,E_{std})$ and $(V,E_{ctc})$ are called the \newterm{standard fan} and
the \newterm{contact fan}, respectively.  
\end{definition}
%Let $\op{hyp}(V,E)$ be the associated
%hypermap.

\indy{Notation}{hyp@$\op{hyp}$ (hypermap)}%
\indy{Notation}{E2@$E_{std}$ (edge set of standard fan)}%
\indy{Notation}{E2@$E_{ctc}$ (edge set of contact fan)}%

\begin{proof} 
  $(V,E_{std})$ is a fan by Lemma~\ref{lemma:std-fan}.  Since
  $E_{ctc}\subset E_{std}$, it follows from
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:subset-fan} that $(V,E_{ctc})$ is a fan.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}[standard fan]\guid{CKQOWSA}\label{lemma:std-fan} 
\formalauthor{Alexey Solovyev}
%older harder proof w/o computers was 1800.
% rating includes the Tarski calculations.
%\formalauthor{Roland Zumkeller: \case{four points} by Bernstein polynomials}
Let $V\subset \BB$ be a packing.  
Then $(V,E_{std})$ is a fan.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The properties \case{cardinality}, \case{origin}, and \case{nonparallel} (on page~\pageref{def:fan}) 
follow
by the methods of Remark~\ref{remark:fan-verify}.

\case{intersection} Some geometrical reasoning is required to
establish the intersection property.  The case
\[ 
C\{\u\}\cap C\{\v\} = \{\orz\}
\] 
follows from the strict triangle inequality 
\[ 
\normo{\u} \le 2\hm < 4 \le \normo{\v} + \norm{\u}{\v}.
\] 
The other cases of the proof are based on the following two facts from
Tarski arithmetic.  
%The second fact is a consequence of the theory of
%Cayley--Menger determinants, as described in Remark~\ref{rem:CM5}.
%\footformal{Further details about these calculations
%  can be found in
%  \url{http://www.math.pitt.edu/~thales/papers/Lemmas_Elementary_Geometry.pdf}
%  Lemma 58 (UQQVJON) and Lemma 60 (ZHBBLXP).  An alternative approach
%  to the proof of \case{four points} proceeds as follows. Assume a
%  counterexample to \case{four points} exists. By symmetry we may
%  assume without loss of generality that a counterexample satisfies the further
%incidence relation
%$\op{conv}\{\v_1,\v_3\}$   meets  $\op{conv}\{\v_0,\v_4,\v_2\}$, where
%we set $\v_0=\orz$.
%  The set of all counterexamples $\{\v_1,\ldots,\v_4\}$ satisfying this further
%incidence relation
%is a nonempty compact set $X_0$ of $\ring{R}^{12}$, because all of the defining conditions are closed conditions and $\BB$ is bounded.  Among all countexamples, consider the
%nonempty subset $X_1$ of those configurations in $X_0$ that maximize the continuously differentiable function $\normo{\v_4}+\normo{\v_2}+\norm{\v_4}{\v_2}$.  For configurations in $X_1$,
%the maximum of this continuously differentiable function is the {\it boundary value} $\norm{\v_i}{\v_j}=2.52$, with $i\ne j\in\{0,2,4\}$ because otherwise we are not
%at a critical point of the function.  Let $X_2$ be the compact subset of $X_1$
%that minimizes the continuously differentiable function $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}$.  
%Similar arguments show that there is no interior point critical point, and the
%minimum appears at the boundary when $\norm{\v_i}{\v_j}=2$ for $i=1,3$ and $j=0,2,4$.
%The function $\mu_V$ (from
%the {\it Lemmas in Elementary Geometry} collection Lemma PFDFWWV) computes the
%value of $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}$, which is larger than $2.52$.  This contradicts
%what is assumed.
%}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \case{three points} Let $\{\v_1,\v_2,\v_3\}\subset \BB$ be a
  packing of three points.  Assume that $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}\le 2\hm$.
  Then $\v_2\not\in C\{\v_1,\v_3\}$.
\item \case{four points} Let $\{\v_1,\v_2,\v_3,\v_4\}\subset \BB$ be a
  packing of four points.  Assume that $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}\le 2\hm$ and
  $\norm{\v_4}{\v_2}\le 2\hm$.  Then $C\{\v_1,\v_3\}\cap
  C\{\v_4,\v_2\} = \{\orz\}$.
\end{enumerate}
We give a proof of \case{three points} by contradiction, assuming that
some configuration exists with $\v_2\in C\{\v_1,\v_3\}$.
%, and in the
%more general setting where the constraint $2\le \norm{\v_1}{\v_3}$ is
%dropped.  
We consider two cases, depending on whether $\v_2$ lies in 
the convex hull of $\{\v_0,\v_1,\v_3\}$, where $\v_0=\orz$.  
If it does lie in this hull, 
then $\norm{\v_2}{\v_i}\le 2\hm$ for $i=1,3$ because every
side of the triangle has length at most $2\hm$.
The proof then
follows from a \cc{TVAWGDR} % old:{4717061266}
{A certain configuration of four points
cannot be coplanar.} that $\Delta(x_{ij})>0$ for  
$x_{ij}=\norm{\v_i}{\v_j}^2$, which contradicts Remark~\ref{rem:cayley},
asserting that the polynomial $\Delta$ vanishes on every planar arrangement of four
points $\{\v_0,\v_1,\v_3,\v_2\}$.

In the second case, the segment $\op{conv}\{\v_1,\v_3\}$ meets
$\op{conv}\{\v_0,\v_2\}$.
We drop the constraint $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}\ge 2$
and continuously deform 
the configuration to contract the norm $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}$ as much as possible.
%The contractions can be made along circles of intersection of pairs of spheres
%at v0 v2 v4.  The closest point of the circle creates coplanarity of four points.
When this norm is as small as possible, the four points $\{\v_0,\ldots,\v_3\}$
are the extreme points of 
a rhombus of side length $r=2$.  We reach the contradiction by calculating
the squares of the diagonals of the rhombus:
\[
16 = 4r^2 =  \norm{\v_0}{\v_2}^2 + \norm{\v_1}{\v_3}^2 
  \le (2\hm)^2 + (2\hm)^2 < 16.
  \]

  The proof of \case{four points} is also a proof by contradiction,
  assuming as we may by symmetry that $\op{conv}\{\v_1,\v_3\}$ meets
  $\op{conv}\{\v_0,\v_4,\v_2\}$, where $\v_0=\orz$.  Again, we drop
  the constraint $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}\ge 2$ and continuously deform the
  configuration to contract the norm $\norm{\v_1}{\v_3}$ as much as
  possible.  By \case{three points}, the continuous contraction does
  not pass through any configurations in which four of the points are
  coplanar.  When the norm is as small as possible the lengths satisfy
  $\norm{\v_i}{\v_j}=2$ for $i=0,2,4$ and $j=1,3$.  Let $\v_0^*$ be
  the reflection of $\v_0$ through the circumcenter of
  $\{\v_0,\v_2,\v_4\}$.  The four points $\{\v_1,\v_3,\v_0,\v_0^*\}$
  are the extreme points of a rhombus of side length $r=2$. We reach
  the following contradiction by calculating the squares of the diagonals of the
  rhombus:
\[
16 = 4r^2 = \norm{\v_0}{\v_0^*}^2 + \norm{\v_1}{\v_3}^2 
  \le (2\eta(2\hm,2\hm,2\hm))^2 + (2\hm)^2 < 16,
\]
where $\eta(a,b,c)$ is the circumradius of a triangle with sides $a,b,c$.
%A \c{3611774025}{A Cayley--Menger determinant is negative.} 
%now shows that under these additional
%constraints the Cayley--Menger determinant of the five points%
%$\{\v_0,\ldots,\v_4\}$ is negative.  This contradicts Remark~\ref{rem:CM5},
%which asserts that the Cayley--Menger determinant of any five points in
%$\ring{R}^3$ is zero.
\end{proof}

\subsection{surrounded and isolated nodes}

\begin{lemma*}[]\guid{FATUGPD}
\formalauthor{Quyen}
\label{lemma:iso-surround}
Given any packing $V\subset \BB$,
there exists a bijection $\phi:V\to V'$ with a  packing $V'$ 
such that $\normo{\v} = \normo{\phi(\v)}$ and
such that every node $\v'$ in the contact fan of $V'$
is either isolated or surrounded.
\end{lemma*}
\indy{Index}{packing!finite}%
\indy{Index}{fan!contact}%
\indy{Notation}{V@$V'$ (packing)}%

\begin{proof} Consider all finite packings in bijective correspondence
  with $V$ such that the bijection preserves distances to
  the origin.  Among these packings, select one, $V'$, with the largest
  number of isolated points in the contact graph.  

We assume for a contradiction that  there is a point
  $\v\in V'$ that is not isolated and not surrounded.  It  has a
  dart in the contact fan with angle at least $\pi$.  Perturb $\v$ away from the
  contacts, making it isolated, while preserving its distance from
  the origin.  The perturbed packing $V''$ has at least one more isolated point
  than $V'$, in violation of the supposed maximality of $V'$.
  Hence, the conclusion of the lemma holds for $V'$.
\end{proof}

The following lemma shows that the corresponding result holds for the
standard fan.  Beware!  The set of isolated and surrounded
nodes depends on a choice of fan.  The next proof makes frequent use
of two different fans $(V,E_{std})$ and $(V,E_{ctc})$, which have
different sets of isolated and surrounded nodes, even though the
set $V$ is the same in both cases.



\begin{lemma}[]\guid{FNJLBXS} % typo FJLBXS
\label{lemma:surrounded}  % 
  Assume that there exists a counterexample to
  Inequality~\ref{eqn:CCE}.  Then there also exists a counterexample
  $V$ to the inequality with the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}\wasitemize 
\item $V\subset \BB$ is a packing.
\item $\CalL(V) > 12$, and no finite packing in $\BB$ attains a value
  larger than $\CalL(V)$.
\item The cardinality of $V$ is thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen.
\item For every  $\v\in V$, the node $\v$ is surrounded or isolated
in the standard fan $(V,E_{std})$.
\end{enumerate}\wasitemize 
%Given any packing $V\subset \BB$, there exists bijection $\phi:V\to
%V'$ with some packing $V'$ such that $\normo{\v} = \normo{\phi(\v)}$
%and such that every node $\v'$ in the standard fan of $V'$ is isolated
%or surrounded.  
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof} 
  The cardinality of a counterexample is between thirteen and fifteen, by
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:13-14}.  The space of all packings $V\subset \BB$
  of cardinality thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen is a compact topological space.
  The function $V\mapsto {\CalL(V)}$ is continuous.  Hence by 
    real analysis, the maximum is achieved by some $W\subset \BB$.
The packing $W$ has the first three properties of the lemma.

\indy{Notation}{V4H@$\CalV$ (configuration space)}%
Let $\CalV$ be given by
\begin{alignat*}{8}
\CalV &= 
\{
(V,\phi) &&\mid \\
 &&&\quad  V\subset \BB \text{ is a packing, }\\
 &&&\quad \phi:W\to V \text{ is a bijection, ~and }\\
 &&&\quad\forall \v\in W.~\normo{\phi(\v)}=\normo{\v}.\\
&\phantom{=~}\}.
\end{alignat*}
The norm condition gives $\CalL(W)=\CalL(V)$ for all $(V,\phi)\in \CalV$.
By fixing an enumeration $W=\{\v_0,\ldots,\v_{k-1}\}$, we identify
$\CalV$ with a compact subspace of $\BB^k\subset\ring{R}^{3k}$.
Also, $\CalV$ is nonempty, because it contains $(W,I_{W})$.
If $(V,\phi)\in \CalV$, then $V$ has the first three properties of the lemma.

%For any packing $V'\subset \BB$, let $V'_{\text{c-iso}},V'_{\text{c-sur}}$
%  be the sets of isolated and surrounded nodes of $V'$
%  respectively, in the \newterm{contact} fan.  By the previous lemma,
%  assume without generality that every node $\v$ in the contact fan
%  of $V$ is either isolated or surrounded.

%\claim{The set $\CalV$ is a nonempty compact topological space.}
%Indeed, by fixing an enumeration $V = \{\v_0,\ldots,\v_r\}$, the set
%$\CalV$ embeds into Euclidean space of dimension $3r$ under the map
%that sends the pair $(V',\phi)$ to the point
%$(\phi^{-1}\v_0,\ldots,\phi^{-1}\v_r)$.  Thus, $\CalV$ carries a
%metric space topology as a subset of Euclidean space.  With a little
%argument, it follows from the boundedness of $V\subset B(0,2\hm)$ that
%$\CalV$ is compact.  Also, $(V,I)\in \CalV$, so $\CalV\ne\emptyset$.


For any pair $(V,\phi)$ in $\CalV$ and $\v\in V$, let
$c(V,\v)$ be the minimum distance from $\v$ to a point in
$V\setminus \{\v\}$.  For $i=0,\ldots,k-1$ define
$c_i=c_i(V)$, by ordering the real numbers
$c(V,\v)$, $\v\in V$,  in increasing order:
\[ 
c_0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le \cdots \le c_{k-1}.
\] 
The functions $c_i:\CalV\to\ring{R}$ are  continuous on the
compact  space $\CalV$.  There is a nonempty compact
subset $\CalV_0$ of $\CalV$ on which $c_0$ attains its maximum
value. Continuing recursively, there is a nonempty compact subset
$\CalV_{i+1}$ of $\CalV_{i}$ on which $c_{i+1}$ attains its maximum value.
\indy{Notation}{c i@$c_i$ (ranking functions on a packing)}%

%For the configuration $(V,I)\in \CalV$, it follows that $c_0(V,I) >2$.
%Hence, $c_0(V',\phi)>2$ for $(V',\phi)\in\CalV_0$.  It follows
%that $V'_{\text{c-iso}}=\phi(V_{\text{c-iso}})$ is in bijective correspondence with
%$V_{\text{c-iso}}$ for all $(V',\phi)\in \CalV_0$.

\claim{Any $(V,\phi)\in \CalV_n$ has the fourth enumerated property of the lemma.}
Otherwise, there exists some node $\v\in V$ 
that is neither isolated nor surrounded in the standard fan.
%Any such node satisfies $c(V,\v)=c_i(V,\phi)$ for some
%$i$.  We may assume $i$ minimal in the sense that 
There exist $i$ and $j$ such that
\[ 
\{k\mid c_k(V) = c(V,\v)\} = \{k\mid i\le k\le j\}.
\] 
%$c_j(V,\phi)=c_i(V,\phi)$ implies $j\ge i$.
%Write
%\[ 
%  c(V,\v) = c_i(V,\phi) = c_{i+1}(V,\phi) 
%=\cdots= c_j(V,\phi) < c_{j+1}(V,\phi),
%\] 
%for some $j\ge i$.  
As $\v$ is not isolated in the standard fan, it
follows that $c(V,\v) \le 2\hm$.  As $\v$ is not surrounded in the
standard fan in the cyclic order on
\[ 
\{\w\in V \mid \norm{\w}{\v} = c(V,\v)\},
\] 
some azimuth angle is at least $\pi$.
Thus, there is a direction in which $\v$ can be perturbed
that  fixes $c_0,\ldots,c_{i-1}$, does not decrease $c_i,\ldots,c_{j-1}$, and increases $c_j$.
This is contrary to the defining property of
$(V,\phi)\in\CalV_n\subset\CalV_j\subset\CalV_i$.  This establishes the claim.

\begin{lemma}[]\guid{FCDJDOT}\label{lemma:CE} 
  Assume that there exists a counterexample to
  Inequality~\ref{eqn:CCE}.  Then there also exists a counterexample
  $V$ to the inequality with the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}\wasitemize 
\item $V\subset \BB$ is a packing.
\item $\CalL(V) > 12$, and no finite packing in $\BB$ attains a value
  larger than $\CalL(V)$.
\item The cardinality of $V$ is thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen.
\item Every node $\v$ is surrounded in the standard fan $(V,E_{std})$.
\item Every node $\v$ that is not surrounded in the contact fan $(V,E_{ctc})$ satisfies $\normo{\v}=2$.
\end{enumerate}\wasitemize 
\end{lemma}
\indy{Notation}{L1@$\CalL(V)$ (estimation of a packing)}%

\begin{proof} By Lemma~\ref{lemma:surrounded}, some counterexample $V$
  satisfies the first three properties and in which every node is
  surrounded or isolated in the standard fan.  By
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:D'}, if there are any isolated nodes in the
  standard fan, then it is not a counterexample.  Hence, every node
  is surrounded in the standard fan.

  \claim{A node $\v$ that is not surrounded in the contact fan
    satisfies $\normo{\v}=2$.}  Otherwise, the counterexample does not
  maximize $\CalL$.  In fact, the packing that replaces $\v$ with
  $(1-\epsilon)\v$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$ does better.

  A finite packing  $V$ is a \newterm{contravening} packing if it

\section{Contravention is Tame}
\indy{Index}{tame!contravention}%
\label{sec:contraproof}

This section and the next one prove that every contravening hypermap is tame.

Let $V$ be a contravening packing with standard fan
$(V,E)=(V,E_{std})$ and let $H=\op{hyp}(V,E)=(D,e,n,f)$ be the
hypermap attached to $(V,E)$.  The fan $(V,E)$ is fully surrounded and
a conforming fan by Lemma~\ref{lemma:face}.  We recall some of the
properties of conforming fans from Section~\ref{sec:conformance}.  The
hypermap $H$ is plain, planar, connected, and simple.  The set of
topological components of $Y(V,E)$ is in bijection with the set of
faces of $H$.  \indy{Notation}{H@$H$ (hypermap)}%
For each face of $H$, the corresponding component $U_F$ is eventually
radial with solid angle

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:solUF}
\sol(U_F) = 2\pi + \sum_{x\in F} (\op{azim}(x) -\pi).
\end{equation}
Recall that
\begin{equation} 
\sum_{F} \sol(U_F) = 4\pi.
\end{equation}
Set 
\[ h(x) = \normo{\nd(x)}/2,\] 
where as usual, $\nd:F\to V$ is given by
\[ 
x \mapsto \nd(x); \quad   x = (\nd(x),\ldots).
\] 
\formaldef{$\nd$}{FST}


Define the weight function
\begin{align}
  \tau(V,E,F) &=\sum_{x\in F} \op{azim}(x)
  \left(1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}(1- L(h(x)))\right) 
  + \left(\pi+{\sol_0}\right) (2- k(F))\qquad\phantom{t}\vspace{6pt}\nonumber\\
  &= \sol(U_F) + (2- k(F))\sol_0 - \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}
\sum_{x\in F}\op{azim}(x) (L(h(x)) - 1)\vspace{6pt}\nonumber\\
  &= \sol(U_F) \left( 1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}\right) 
- \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi} \sum_{x\in F} \op{azim}(x)(L(h(x))),\label{eqn:tau-sol}
\end{align}
where $\sol_0$ is the solid angle of a spherical equilateral triangle with a side of arclength $\pi/3$, and $k(F)$ is the cardinality of $F$.
% 
These formulas are equivalent by Equation~\ref{eqn:solUF}.  
The first expression for $\tau(V,E,F)$
is particularly convenient because it expresses $\tau$ as a sum of
local contributions from each dart.

The main conjecture may be expressed in the following alternative
form.

\begin{lemma}[target]\guid{HRXEFDM}\label{lemma:4pi-sol}
Let $V$ be a contravening packing. % and let $(V,E_{std})=(V,E_{std})$ be the standard fan.
Then
\[ 
\sum_F \tau (V,E_{std},F) < 4\pi - 20\sol_0.
\] 
The sum runs over the faces $F$ of $\op{hyp}(V,E_{std})$.
%if and only if
%\[ 
%\CalL(V)\le 12.
%\] 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Use the formula \eqref{eqn:tau-sol}.
  The sum of the solid angles $U_F$ is $4\pi$, and the sum of the azimuth
  angles at each node is $2\pi$.
% The Euler relation for connected plain planar hypermaps gives
%\[ 
%\sum_F (2- k(F)) = 2\#f - 2\#e = 4 - 2\#n.
%\] 
Thus,
\begin{align}\label{eqn:delta0}
  \sum_F \tau (V,E_{std},F) 
  &= 4\pi \left(1 + \dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}\right) 
- \left(\dfrac{\sol_0}{\pi}\right) 2\pi \sum_{V} L(\normo{\v}/2)\vspace{6pt}\\
&= (4\pi - 20\sol_0) + 2\sol_0 (12 - \CalL(V)).
\end{align}
In a contravening packing, $2\sol_0(12-\CalL(V))<0$.
The result ensues.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:tgt}
The significance of the constant $\op{tgt}=1.541$ is that it is a
convenient rational approximation to the constant $4\pi -
20\sol_0\approx 1.54065$, which appears in Lemma~\ref{lemma:4pi-sol}.

Many of the properties of tameness are trivial or have been

of tameness on page~\pageref{def:tame}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The hypermap is plain, planar, connected, and simple by the general
  results established in the chapter on fan.  That chapter also shows
  that the hypermap attached to a fan satisfies properties
  \case{nondegenerate}, \case{no loops}, and \case{no double joins}.

%The property~(vi) is established in \cite[Lemma~3.7]{sp1}.
  \claim{Properties~\case{face count} and the first half of
    property~\case{node size} hold}.  Indeed, every node is
  surrounded, meaning that the azimuth angles of the darts at the
  node are less than $\pi$.  As the angles around the node sum to
  $2\pi$, there are at least three darts in the node. Each of the
  darts in the node leads into a different face by
  property~\case{simple}.

%% 13 or 14 nodes.
  Finally, property~\case{node count} has already been established in
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:CE}.

The angle bounds are a \cc{KCBLRQC}{}.  The sum of the azimuth angles
around a node satisfies:

p (0.852) + (q+r) (1.15) \le 2\pi < p (1.9) + (q+r) \pi,

\begin{lemma}[]\guid{KCBLRQC} \label{lemma:weightB}
  Let $\v$ be a node of type $(p,q,0)$ in a contravening hypermap.
  Then the property~\case{bound b} of a admissible weight assignment

\[ \tau(V,E,F) \ge a~\op{azim}(x) + b\] 
for some $a,b\in\ring{R}$, where $x$ is the uniquely determined dart

obtained from the (downward rounded) solutions to these linear

  Every contravening hypermap satisfies properties \case{node types}

  in the same way as the proof of that lemma.  The linear programming
  bounds exceed the constant $\op{tgt}$ in the cases excluded in the

\subsection{faces}



\begin{lemma}[]\guid{CRTTXAT}  \label{lemma:face-size}
  Property~\case{face size} holds.  That is, every face of a
  contravening hypermap $\op{hyp}(V,E_{std})$ has cardinality at least
  three and at most six.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The lower bound holds because the hypermap has no loops
  or double joins.  (See Lemma~\ref{lemma:dj}.)  

Let $F$ be a face of the
  hypermap of cardinality $k$.  The inequalities $\CalL(V)\ge 12$,
 ~$L(h_i)\le1$, and $\card(V)\le 15$ 
imply that
\begin{align*}
12 &\le \CalL(V) \\
   &= \sum_{i=1}^k L(h_i) + \sum_{i={k+1}}^{\op{card}(V)} L(h_i) \\
   &\le \sum_{i=1}^k L(h_i) + (\op{card}(V)-k)\\
   &\le \sum_{i=1}^k \dfrac{h_0-h_i}{h_0-1} + (15-k),
\end{align*}
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:L7}
%\sum_{\v\in \nd(F)} L(\normo{\v}/2) \ge 12-(\op{card}(V)-k)\ge k-3,
%\end{equation}
%with the sum  running over the image of $\nd:F\to V$.
%More explicitly,
%\[
%\sum_{i=1}^k L(h_i) = \sum_{i=1}^k \dfrac{h_0-h_i}{h_0-1} \ge k - 3,
%\]
or
\[
\sum_{i=1}^k h_i \le -(h_0-1) (k-3) + k h_0.
\]
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:convex-hyp} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:g-ineq},
the perimeter $P$ of $F$ satisfies
\[
2\pi\ge P\ge
\sum_{i=1}^k \arc(2h_i,2h_{i+1},2)\ge 2\sum_{i=1}^k g(h_i)
\]
where $g(h) = \arccos(h/2)-\pi/6$ and
where $h_i\in \leftclosed 1,\hm\rightclosed$.

A calculation of the second derivative shows that the function $g$ is concave.
Let $g_1(h) = a h + b\approx -0.61 h + 1.13$ 
be the linear secant approximation to $g_1$ on 
$\leftclosed 1,\hm\rightclosed$:
\[
g_1(1) = g(1),\quad g_1(\hm) = g(\hm).
\]
Then $a<0$ and
\begin{align*}
2\pi &\ge 2\sum_{i=1}^k g_1(h_i) \\
   &\ge 2 a \sum_{i=1}^k h_i + 2 k b\\
   &\ge 2 a \left[ -(h_0-1) (k-3) + k h_0  \right] + 2 k b.
\end{align*}
Solving for $k$, we get $k < 7$.
%
% and by \eqref{eqn:L7}
%\[
%\sum_{i} (2h_0 - (h_i+h_i')) \ge (12+k - \op{card}(V)) 2 (h_0-1).
%\]
%The minimum is thus achieved when the variables $h_i$ and $h_i'$ are
% extremal.  From the upper bound $\op{card}(V)\le 15$, it follows
% that the perimeter is at least
%\begin{align*}
%2 (\op{card}(V) -12) \arc(2h_0,2,2) + (k - 2(\op{card}(V)-12)) \arc(2,2,2) &\ge\\
%6 \arc(2h_0,2,2) + \arc(2,2,2) &> 2\pi.
%\end{align*}
%This perimeter bound is contrary to the bound on perimeter in
% Lemma~\ref{lemma:convex-hyp}.
\end{proof}


%Divide the proof into cases
% depending on whether the following inequality holds:
%\[ 
%\sum _{x\in F} (\normo{\nd(x)}-2) \ge 4(\hm-1).
%\] 
%If the inequality holds, then since $L$ is the linear interpolation
%between the points $(1,1)$ and $(\hm,0)$, and there are at most fourteen
%points in $V$, it follows that
%\[ 
%\CalL(V) = \sum_{\v\in V}L(\normo{\v}/2) \le 12 L(1) + 2 L(\hm) =12,
%\] 
%and the main inequality holds.
%
%Now assume that the inequality is false.
%The edge $\{\v,\w\}$ has arclength at least
%\[ 
%  \arc(\normo{\v},\normo{\w},\norm{\v}{\w}) 
%\ge \arc(\normo{\v},\normo{\w},2). 
%\] 
%
%A calculation~\cite[cc:arc]{website:FlyspeckProject} gives
%\begin{equation}
%\arc(\normo{\v},\normo{\w},2)
%\ge 1 - 0.6076 (\normo{\w}/2 - 1) - 0.6076 (\normo{\v}/2 - 1).
%\end{equation} %%CC:arc
%The sum over a face of size at least $7$ gives
%\[ 
%\begin{align}
%\sum \arc(\normo{\v_i},\normo{\v_{i+1}},\norm{\v_i}{\v_{i+1}})&\ge
%7 - 0.6076 \sum (\normo{\v_i}-2) \\
%&\ge 7 - 0.6076 (4)(h_0-1)\\
%&> 2\pi.
%\end{align}
%\] 
%The left-hand side is the perimeter of the localization of $(V,E)$

%\subsection{admissibility}
%\label{sec:admissibility}


The main result (Lemma~\ref{lemma:main}) of this section is a proof
that for every contravening hypermap $H=\op{hyp}(V,E)$, the function
$\tau(V,E,\wild)$ is an admissible weight assignment on $H$.



\begin{lemma}[]\guid{GBMLQWW}\cutrate{}  \label{lemma:tau-local}
  Let $V$ be a contravening packing, and
  let $F$ be any face of $\op{hyp}(V,E_{std})$.  Then
\[ 
\tau(V,E_{std},F) = \tau(V',E',F),
\] 
where $(V',E',F)$ is the localization of $(V,E_{std})$ along the face $F$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The value $\tau(V,E,F)$ is expressed entirely in terms
  of $\normo{\v}$ for $\v\in V'\subset V$ and in terms of
  $\op{azim}(x)$ for $x\in F$.  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:localization},
  the terms $\op{azim}(x)$ are the same, whether calculated in terms
  of the hypermap of $(V,E_{std})$ or in terms of that of $(V',E')$.
\end{proof}










%
%\begin{lemma}[]\guid{BGDPIZY}\cutrate{}
%Suppose that
%\[ 
%\tau(V,E,F) \ge d (r,s)
%\] 
%for every special fan $(V,E,F,S)$,
%where $(r,s)$ are the parameters of the special fan.
%Then Lemma~\ref{lemma:main} holds.

Let $V_0$ be a contravening packing, and let $F$ be any
face of $\op{hyp}(V_0,E_{std})$ of cardinality $k$.  Then
 property~\case{weight bound d} holds.  
That is,
$\tau(V_0,E_{std},F) \ge d(k)$.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Notation}{F@$F$ (hypermap face)}%

\begin{proof}
  Let $V_0$ be a contravening packing.  By
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:tau-local}, $\tau(V_0,E_{std},F)=\tau(V,E,F)$, where
  $(V,E,F)$ is the localization of $(V_0,E_{std})$ along $F$.

  \claim{The tuple $(V,E,F)$ satisfies the conditions of
    Theorem~\ref{lemma:empty-d}.}  Indeed, every property can be
  verified in turn.  The properties \case{packing} and \case{annulus}
  result from the assumption that $V$ is contravening packing.

\case{nonreflexive local fan}  The localization $(V,E,F)$ is a nonreflexive local fan
by Lemma~\ref{lemma:localize-nonreflexive}.
\case{diagonal} If $\norm{\v}{\w}<2\hm$ and $\v\ne \w$, then $\{\v,\w\}\in
E_{std}$.
% Assume that $v,w\in V$ and $C^0\{v,w\}\subset \Wdarto(x)$ for all
% $x\in F$.  The intersection of the sets $\Wdarto(x)$ is the
% topological component $U_F$ of $Y(V_0,E_{std})$.  Thus,
% $C^0\{v,w\}\subset Y(V_0,E_{std})$.  Assume for a contradiction that
% $\norm{v}{w}< 2\hm$. Then by the definition of $E_{std}$,
% $\{v,w\}\in E_{std}$.  Hence, $C^0\{v,w\}\subset
% X(V_0,E_{std})$. This leads to a contradiction because $C^0\{v,w\}$
% is nonempty, and $X(V_0,E_{std})\cap Y(V_0,E_{std})=\emptyset$.
%
%\case{subset} \case{s norm} These properties are trivial because
%$S=\emptyset$.
%
%\case{e norm} If $\{v,w\}\in E$, then $\{v,w\}\in E$.  It follows from
%the definition of standard fan that $2\le \norm{v}{w}\le 2\hm$.
\case{card} The bound $3\le \card(F)\le 6$
follows from Lemma~\ref{lemma:face-size}.


%By Lemma~\ref{lemma:min-empty}, the set of minimal fans is empty.
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:tau3} and Theorem~\ref{lemma:empty-d}, 
\[ 
\tau(V_0,E_{std},F)=\tau(V,E,F) \ge d (k).
\] 
This completes the proof.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
  It is helpful to keep in mind the origin of the constants $d(k)$.
  Although the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:main} does not produce sharp
  lower bounds on $\tau(V,E,F)$, the statement of the lemma is
  motivated by the configurations that follow.  Consider a nonplanar
  polygon whose vertices lie on a sphere of radius $2$, with $k$ sides
  all of length $y_{i,i+1}=2$, heights $y_i=2$, and $k-3$ diagonals of
  length $2\hm$: $y_{0,j}=2\hm$ for $j=2,\ldots,k-2$
  (Figure~\ref{fig:dk-poly}).  Let $V$ be the set of vertices of the
  polygon, let $(V,E_{ctc})$ be its contact fan, and let $F$ be the
  face of $\op{hyp}(V,E_{ctc})$ representing the ``interior'' of the
  polygon.  Evaluating $\tau$ on these rigid configurations gives
\[ 
\tau(V,E_{ctc},F) \approx
\begin{cases}
0.20612 & k=4\\
0.48356 & k=5\\
0.760993 &k=6.
\end{cases}
\] 
These calculations suggested the values of constants $d(k)$.  The
constants $d(k)$ are slightly smaller than these calculated values.%

\begin{lemma}[]\guid{RUNOQPQ}\cutrate{}
Every tame hypermap is a restricted hypermap.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By definition, a tame hypermap is nonempty, connected, plain,
  planar, and simple.  The edge and node maps
  have no fixed points.  The cardinality of every face is at least
  three.  These are also precisely the defining properties of a restricted
  hypermap.

%We have used computers to generate a list of all hypermaps and to check
%them against the archive of tame hypermaps.  The computer program is
%based on the hypermap generation construction of
%Section~\ref{sec:face-insert}.  According to the results of that
%section, every restricted hypermap can be generated by an elementary
%edge-insertion algorithm.  Every tame hypermap is a restricted
%hypermap.  The list of restricted hypermaps can be filtered to obtain
%a complete list of tame hypermaps.  


\section{Linear Programs}\label{sec:tsp}
%\subsection{Classification}
\label{sec:proof-classification}
\label{sec:classification}



This is a short section, but it represents a major part of the proof
of the Kepler conjecture.  It is short only because the calculations
are better expressed as computer code than as published text.  The
code appears at the project
website~\cite{website:FlyspeckProject}.  
%Appendix~\ref{sec:lp} gives
%details about the computational methods that have been used.

The classification result in this section is one of the main results
of this book.  All of the work to prove the classification algorithm
has been completed in the chapter on hypermaps.  A list of hypermaps
appears at \cite{website:FlyspeckProject}.  The following theorem has
been established by executing a computer program that generates tame
hypermaps.  The program generates restricted hypermaps and filters out
those that are not tame.  About $25,000$ tame hypermaps occur in
the output of the program.  Several examples appear in
Figure~\ref{fig:tame-graph}.
%Further details about this program appear in
%the Appendix~\ref{sec:hyper-gener}.
\indy{Index}{computer calculation}%

\begin{theorem}\guid{WTEMDTA}
  \label{theorem:classification} Every tame hypermap is isomorphic to
  a hypermap in the list~\cite{website:FlyspeckProject} or is
  isomorphic to the opposite of a hypermap in the list.
  \indy{Index}{isomorphism!tame hypermap classification}%
\end{theorem}

Because of this classification, we may attach an explicit linear
program to each tame hypermap.  For each tame hypermap $H$ there is a
configuration space $\CalV_H$ of all contravening packings $V\subset
\BB$, whose standard fan is isomorphic to $H$ or to the
opposite of $H$.  
\indy{Notation}{H@$H$ (hypermap)}%
\indy{Notation}{V4H@$\CalV_H$ (configuration space)}%

A nonlinear optimization problem asks for the maximum of
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:L2}
\CalL(V)=\sum_{\v\in V} L(\normo{\v}/2)
\end{equation}
over all $V\in \CalV_H$.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:L-bound}  
Let $H$ be a tame hypermap that appears in the
explicit list~\cite{website:FlyspeckProject}.  Let $V\in \CalV_H$.  Then
\[
\CalL(V) < 12.
\]
\end{theorem}
\indy{Notation}{L1@$\CalL(V)$ (estimation of a packing)}%

\begin{proof}
  The linear program comes as a linear relaxation of this nonlinear
  optimization problem on $\CalV_H$. That is, the optimal solution of
  the linear program has value at least as great as the corresponding
  nonlinear problem.  When a single linear program is not sufficient,
  branch and bound methods replace the single linear program with a
  finite sequence of linear progams.  About $50,000$ linear
  programs arise.  By showing that the value of each linear program is
  less than $12$, we conclude that the maximum of \eqref{eqn:L2} is less than
   $12$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}  The Kepler conjecture holds: no packing of congruent
balls in three-dimensional Euclidean space
 has density greater than the face-centered cubic packing (of
density $\pi/\nsqrt{18}$).
\end{theorem}
\indy{Index}{Kepler conjecture}%

\begin{proof} We take the precise meaning of the Kepler conjecture to
  be that given in Remark~\ref{remark:precise}.  We argue by
  contradiction.  If the Kepler conjecture is false, then by
  Lemma~\ref{cor:CE}, there exists a finite packing
  $V\subset\BB$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:LV}
\CalL(V) > 12.
\end{equation}
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:CE} and Definition~\ref{def:contravening}, we may
assume that $V$ is a contravening packing.  Let $(V,E_{std})$ be the
standard fan of $V$, and let $H$ be the fan's hypermap.  By
Theorem~\ref{theorem:contravene}, the hypermap $H$ is tame.  By
Theorem~\ref{theorem:classification}, either $H$ or its opposite is
isomorphic to a tame hypermap in the classification list.  By the
definition of $\CalV_H$, we have $V\in \CalV_H$.  By
Theorem~\ref{theorem:L-bound},
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:done-L12}
\CalL(V) < 12,
\end{equation}
for all $V\in \CalV_H$.
This contradicts Inequality~\ref{eqn:LV}.
\end{proof}
