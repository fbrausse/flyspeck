\section{Connecting with Bauer-Nipkow 
work in Isabelle}

This section builds on the HOL-Light files hypermap.hl
and import-tame-classificaton.hl.

For simplicity of typesetting, we use a dash in this text to
represent an undescore in HOL Light.

\subsection{basic definitions}

(This section has been formalized 2/2014.)

In the Bauer-Nipkow work, there is a type for Isabelle graphs,
which we abbreviate to lgraph.   There is a predicate
planegraph that expresses lgraph planarity.  There is also a slightly
broader class planegraph-relaxed.

\begin{lemma}\guid{DPZGBYF} 
\formalauthor{tchales}
If $g$ is planegraph, then it is also planegraph-relaxed.
\end{lemma}

There is a function, fgraph, that maps an lgraph to
the list of list representation of the lgraph.  For example,
the list of list representation of a planar graph consisting
of a square triangulated into four squares with common
vertex $0$ is
\[
[[0;1;2];[0;2;3];[0;3;4];[0;4;1];[4;3;2;1]].
\]
We refer to these entries $[0;1;2]$, $[0;2;3]$, etc. as the
faces of the lgraph.

There is a function, hypermap-of-list, that maps the
list of list representation of the planar graph into the
corresponding hypermap.  The darts of the hypermap
are consecutive pairs of elements in the list of list
representation.  For example, the example above gives
the dart set
\[
\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,0),~(0,2),(2,3),(3,0),~(0,3),(3,4),(4,0),~
(0,4),(4,1),(1,0),~(4,3),(3,2),(2,1),(1,4)\}.
\]
The face map follows each pair around the face in which it occurs
$f(0,1) = (1,2)$, etc.  The edge map reverses an ordered pair $e(0,1)
= (1,0)$, etc.  The set of integers that appear in this list of list
is in bijection with the set of vertices of the lgraph.  In fact, we
can take this is as the definition of the set of vertices of the
lgraph.  When we refer to the hypermap of $g$, we refer to this
construction.

There is a function, finals, that returns a sublist of the
list of list representaton of the lgraph.

In the Isabelle development, there is a function facesAt.



Since our aim is relate hypermaps to the constructions in Isabelle, which
are based on lists, we give a series of list-based definitions that run
in parallel with hypermap-based definitions.

We make a table of notions about hypermaps and their corresponding list-based notion.
This table serves as a dictionary translating between the different data structures.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{l l}
\hline
{\bf hypermap} & {\bf lists} \\ \hline
loop & loop-list \\
is-contour & contour-list \\
is-normal & normal-list \\
hyp'm, hyp'p, hyp'q & l'm, l'p, l'q \\
hyp'y, hyp'z & l'y, l'z \\
final-quotient-face   & final-list \\
quotient & quotient-list \\
- & final-dart-list \\
- & split-normal-list \\
transform & transform-list \\
hyp'S & s-list \\
s-flagged & s-flag-list \\
empty-flagged & flag-list \\
is-marked & marked-list \\
iso & iso-list \\
hyp-iso & isop-list \\
f-map, n-map, e-map & f-list, n-list, e-list\\
dih2k & dih2k-list\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
We also describe the general correspondence of variable names.

\begin{tabular}{l l}
\hline
{\bf hypermap} & {\bf lists} \\ \hline
H (hypermap) & L (list of lists)\\
NF (normal family) & N \\
L (loop) & r \\
x (dart) & x \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip
We also have conversions from lists to hypermaps.  The constant loop-of-list converts a list to a loop,
and loop-family-of-list converts a list of lists to a family of loops.

There is a function match-core-list that is true when there is a correspondence between
faces of an lgraph g and those of the quotient of L by N, such that the final faces of g are included in those of $N$.
A function match-list also measures the corespondence.  The function loop-choice generates a pair (r,x)
to be used as part of a marked-list, from a lgraph g.





\subsection{properties of planegraph}

\begin{definition}[good-list,~good-list-nodes,~good-graph]
Recall that a list of lists $L$ is a good-list if it has three properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The list of darts of $L$ has no duplicates.
\item Every member of $L$ is non-nil.
\item If $(x,y)$ is a dart of $L$, then so is $(y,x)$.
\end{enumerate}
Recall that a good list $L$ is a good-list-nodes if 
the number of nodes in its hypermap is equal to the number
of vertices of $L$.
We say that an lgraph is is good-graph if it has the properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Its fgraph $L$ is a good-list and a good-list-nodes.
\item all faces of the fgraph are final.
\item In each face, each vertex occur at most once.
\item The vertex set coincides with the set of elements of the fgraph.
\item The facesAt a vertex $v$ is the same as the list of faces that contain $v$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

(We don't need to formalize JUJUWAT, CGGZYRC, and EAHHATZ, because we will get them as a corollary
of the correspondence between restricted hypermaps and plane-graphs.)

\begin{lemma}\guid{JUJUWAT} 
If $g$ is planegraph-relaxed, then its fgraph is a good-list.
\end{lemma}  

\begin{lemma}\guid{CGGZYRC} 
Let $g$ be a planegraph.  Let $F$ be a face of $g$
that is not final.  Let $(x,y)$ be a dart of (the hypermap of) $g$ on face
$F$.
Then $(y,x)$ is a dart on a face that is final.
\end{lemma} 
 
\begin{lemma}\guid{EAHHATZ}
If $g$ is a Plane-graph, then it is a good-graph.
\end{lemma}

In general we want to have the properties of good-list, good-list-nodes, and all-uniq.
The following lemmas show how these properties progagate.
The following properties can be proved by structural induction
for planegraph-relaxed.


\begin{lemma}\guid{ETDLJXT}
If $g$ is planegraph-relaxed, then  the vertices of $g$ are $0,\ldots,n-1$, where
$n$ is the number of nodes of $g$. 
\end{lemma} 


\begin{lemma}\guid{HWDMZDM}
Let $g$ be planegraph-relaxed, and $v$ in the vertex setof $g$.
Then $facesAt~g~v$ is the set of faces of $g$ that $v$ is a member of.
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}\guid{PMBRINH}  If $L$ is good-list-nodes and normal-list-L-N, then good-list-nodes
 holds of quotient-list-L-N.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  It is enough to show that all of the darts with a given first coordinate form a single node of the quotient.
This is clear, because by assumption all the darts of $L$ with a given first coordinate for a single node for $L$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{SNVACWG}  If $L$ is a good-list and good-list-nodes, its hypermap is restricted,
and normal-list-L-N, then good-list holds of quotient-list-L-N.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} We examine each of the defining properties of a good-list.  

\case{uniq}  
If a dart $(a,b)$ occurs more than once  then there are two darts $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in $N$, that run from
nodes $a$ to $b$.  This is impossible by the no-double-joins property of restricted hypermaps.

\case{all-non-nil}  It is a property of normal that its members are not nil.  The same is then true of the quotient.

\case{sym}.  Let $(a,b)$ be a dart in the quotient.  Then there is a dart $(a,b)$ in $N$.  In fact, we see that $(a,b)$ is the last member of
its atom in $N$.  The family $N$ meets the node $b$,
and $(b,a)$ is a dart at the node $b$.  By properties of normal, all darts at the node, including $(b,a)$, are on $N$.
We have $n^{-1}(b,a) = f (a,b)$.  By unicity, $(b,a)$ is followed by an $f$-step in $N$.  This implies that $(b,a)$ is a dart in the
quotient. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{LYNVPSU}  $(L,N,r,s)$ be a marked hypermap.  Then the quotient of $L$ by $N$ is all-uniq.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  This is a defining property of a marked hypermap.
\end{proof}

\subsection{main result}

This result is imported from Isabelle.

\begin{theorem}[Import~Tame~Classification]  Let $g$ be a final
planegraph that is tame.  Then there exists a $y$ in the archive such
that the fgraph of g is fgraph congruent to $y$.
\end{theorem}

The main result to be proved is the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}[LSKOKJE]  Let $H$ be a restricted hypermap.  Then there exists a good-graph g that is a PlaneGraphs,
such that $H$ is isomorphic to the hypermap of $g$.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{isomorphism}


We develop the properties of iso-list, which is the list-based version of isomorphism.
It is a particularly rigid notion, because it does not allow the rearrangement of the elements of a list.
However, it is sufficient for our purposes.

We often need to consider $L$ together with a normal-list $N$.  The definition of iso-list carries with it
a second argument that checks that $N$ is sent to $N'$ under the isomorphism.

\begin{lemma}\guid{GNBEVVU}
\formalauthor{tchales} 
If $L$ is a good-list and $L'$ is an iso-list, then the hypermaps of $L$ and $L'$ are isomorphic.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This follows directly from the theorem hypermap-of-list-map.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} [iso-list-refl,~iso-list-sym,~iso-list-trans] 
\formalauthor{tchales}
The relation iso-list is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
\end{lemma}

The properties of a list $L$ that are invariant under an injective map remain true when $L$ is replaced
with an iso-list.  This gives the following results.

\begin{lemma}\guid{PEUTLZH}
\formalauthor{tchales, 2/2014} 
Let $L$ be a good-list, and $L'$ an iso-list.  Then $L'$ is a good-list.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{OISRWOF}
\formalauthor{tchales, 2/2014} 
Let $L$ be good-list and good-list-nodes, and $L'$ an iso-list.  Then $L'$ is a good-list-nodes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{UEYETNI} 
\formalauthor{tchales, 2/2014}
Let $L$ be all-uniq, and $L'$ an iso-list.  Then $L'$ is a all-uniq.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{XKDZKWV}
 Let $L$ be a good-list with normal-list $N$.  If $(L',N')$ is iso-list, then $N'$ is a normal-list of $L'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{DAKEFCC}
If $H$ and $K$ are isomorphic hypermaps, and if $H$ is restricted, then $K$ is restricted.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{MEEIXJO}
Let $L$ be a good-list with marked-list $(L,N,r,x)$.  If $(L',N',r',x')$ is iso-list, then $(L',N',r',x')$ is a marked-list.
\end{lemma}



\subsection{representing hypermap as lists}

It is convenient to work with lists of list $L$ rather than hypermaps $H$.  This means
we should give a list version of notions such as loop and normal family.
We have loop-list as the list version of a loop and norm-list as the list
version of  a normal family of loops.  




\begin{lemma}\guid{RXOKSKC}
Let $H$ be a restricted hypermap.  Then there exists a list $L$ such that $H$ is its hypermap.
In fact, there exists such an $L$ that is good-list, good-list-nodes, all-uniq.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} We may convert a hypermap to list $L$ as follows.  From each face $F$ of $H$
pick a dart $x$ and form the list $[\op{node}(x),\op{node}(f x),\op{node}(f^2 x),\ldots]$.  
The list of all these lists for each face is defined to be $L$.

A restricted hypermap is simple, hence the elements of the list are uniq.  This gives the all-uniq property.

By construction the elements of these lists are the nodes.  This gives the good-list-nodes property.

We check that it is a good list.  
For the uniqueness property, note that we show below that the map between darts sets is one-to-one.
This means that each dart appears in a face once.

For the non-nil property of good-lists: each list contains $\op{node}(x)$ as the first element. Hence it is
not the nil-list.

For the symmetry property of good-lists: if $(\op{node}(x),\op{node}(f x))$ is a dart, then
\[
(\op{node}(n f x),\op{node}(f n f x)) = (\op{node}(f x),\op{node}(x))
\]
is also a dart.

Finally, we check that $H$ is isomorphic to the hypermap of $L$.  The darts of the hypermap of $L$ are formed by
consecutive pairs $(\op{node}(f^i x),\op{node}(f^{i+1} x))$.  

We claim the map between dart sets, $y\mapsto (\op{node}(y),\op{node}(f y))$, is one-to-one.
This follows from the no-double-joins property of restricted hypermaps.  Specifically,
if $(\op{node}(y),\op{node}(f y)) = (\op{node}(z),\op{node}(f z))$, then the edges $\{y,e y\}$ and $\{z,ez\}$ run
between the same nodes, forcing $y=z$.

The face maps are compatible on the two hypermaps by construction. Finally, the edge map is compatible because
\[
(\op{node}(e y),\op{node}(f (e y))) = (\op{node}(f y),\op{node}(y)) = e-list (\op{node}(y),\op{node}(f y)).
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{JXBJOAB}
\formalauthor{tchales, 2/2014}  
If $L$ is any list of lists, then there is a iso-list $L'$ whose elements are natural numbers.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Pick any injective map from the elements of $L$ to $\ring{N}$ and take the resulting iso-list.
\end{proof}

For the correspondence with Isabelle, we will need to use lists $L$ whose elements are natural numbers and
whose elements are ordered in a particular way.  By taking a permutation on the natural numbers we can obtain
any convenient ordering.  A particular ordering is given by lemma SHXWKXQ.  We refer to the formal statement
in the HOL Light files.  What follows is an informal summary.

\begin{lemma}\guid{SHXWKXQ}.  For any $L$ (good-list, good-list-nodes, all-uniq)
and normal-list $N$.  By passing to an iso-list, we can arrange that the elements appearing
in $N$ are the natural numbers $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices visited by $N$.
Furthermore, if $x$ is any dart, and $F$ is the face in $L$ containing $x$ listed so that $x$ appears at the head of the
list.  Let $F'$ be the filtered list of $F$ containing all the darts of $F$ that are not in $N$.  Then we may also assume that
$F' = [n+1;n+2;n+k]$, where $k$ is the length of $F'$.
\end{lemma}

The following lemma gives a reduction of the main result LSKOKJE.

\begin{lemma}[JCAJYDU]  It is enough to prove LSKOKJE in the case when $H$ is the hypermap of $L$,
where $L$ is a good-list, good-list-nodes, all-uniq, and having elements in the natural numbers.
\end{lemma}


\subsection{translating notions between hypermaps and lists}


We skip the following proofs.  In each case the definitions involved in the correspondence
are direct translations of one another.  Thus, the proofs are a matter of comparing defintions.

\begin{lemma}\guid{GZLJIGN} Under the correspondence between $L$ and its hypermap, the constants
$l'm$, $l'p$, $l'q$, $l'y$, $l'z$ correspond respectively to hyp'm, hyp'p, hyp'q, hyp'y, hyp'z.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{EVNAPDQ} Let $L$ be a good-list.  Let $N$ be a normal list of $L$.
Then the loop family is a normal family of the hypermap of $L$.  
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{ABKCJWD} Let $L$ be a good-list.  Let $N$ be a normal list of $L$.
Then the hypermap of the quotient-list is isomorphic to the quotient of the data
on the hypermap side.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Their respective definitions are direct translations of one another.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{ODWAFRG}  Let $L$ be a good-list and $(L,N,r,x)$ a marked-list.
Then the corresponding data in the hypermap is is-marked.
\end{lemma}

There are also specific lemmas about hypermaps that we wish to translate back into theorems
about lists.  Specifically, we have lemmas HQYMRTX1-list, HQYMRTX2-list, HQYMRTX3-list,
QRDYXYJ-list, AQIUNPP1-list, and AQIUNPP2-list that are list versions of lemmas given in {\it Dense Sphere Packings}.
We omit the proofs here, because the proofs are direct translations from hypermap language to list language.
In fact, it should be possible to deduce them directly from the hypermap version of the lemma.


\subsection{dihedral  initialization}

The fgraph of Seed~p is the list of lists $[[0;1;...;n+2];[n+2;n+1;...;0]]$.

\begin{lemma}[good-list-seed,~all-uniq-seed] \guid{FOEGZEQ}
\formalauthor{tch}
 Seed~p is a good-list and all-uniq.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{TAGYMWJ} Seed~p is a good-list-nodes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{ENWCUED}  Seed~p is dih2k-list.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{DLWOJBB} If $L$ is dih2k-list, then its hypermap is dih2k.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{KUKASGD} Any two dih2k-list's $L$ and $L'$ of the same face size are iso-lists.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{UNHQYQM} If $L$ and $L'$ are iso-lists and $L$ is dih2k-list, then so is $L'$.
\end{lemma}

This is a version of AUQTZYZ for lists.

\begin{lemma}[AUQTZYZ-list]  Let $L$ be good-list with restricted hypermap.
Let $f$ be a face of $L$.  Then there exists a loop-list $f'$ such that $[f;f']$ is normal and the quotient
is $[f,rev~f]$ (which is dih2k-list).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Pick $f'$ to be the complementary path (a concatenation of complementary nodes) of $f$.
\end{proof}

The following is a more precise version of the correspondence of a restricted hypermap with
the seed.  We will apply this lemma to a face with the largest size of $L$.

\begin{lemma}\guid{UYOUIXG}  Let $L$ be a good-list with restricted hypermap.  Assume
that $L$ itself it not dih2k-list.  Let $f$ be any face of $L$.  Then there exists data $(L',N')$ and $f'$
such that $(L,[f;f2])$ is an iso-list of $(L',N')$ and such that $N'$ is a normal-list of $L'$ and
match-core-list between the seed and $(L',N')$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This is obtained by renaming the elements of $L$ to agree exactly with those of the seed.
Note that the heads of both lists $N'$ and the fgraph of the seed are the faces that are final.
\end{proof}





\subsection{termination}

We will obtain termination after a finite sequence of transforms.  Each transform
will increase the number of darts in the the quotient hypermap.  The number of
darts in the quotient is no more than the number of darts in the original.  Finally,
if every path in a normal family is final, then the quotient list of $L$ by $N$ is equal to $L$.

\begin{lemma}\guid{ADACDYF}  Let $(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked-list in which $r$ is not final.
Let $(N',r')$ be the transform of the marked-list.  Then the number of darts in the
quotient of $L$ by $N$ is less than the number of darts in the quotient of $L$ by $N'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  The number of darts in a quotient hypermap is equal
to the number of quotient darts (atoms) in the normal family $N$.
The normal family $N'$ replaces a loop $r$ with $r_1$ and $r_2$
and keeps the other loops the same.  The atoms of $r$ at
$y$ and $z$ are split into two atoms to create $r_1$ and $r_2$.
Hence the number increases.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\guid{ZBHENEI}  The number of darts in a quotient is no more than
the number of darts in the original $L$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The darts of the quotient  are obtained by taking a subset
of the darts of $L$ visitited by $N$ and then combining them into
atoms.  Taking subsets and combining both are non-increasing
in the number of darts.  
\end{proof}

The following upper bound on the number of elements that are final in 
an lgraph, combined with a monotonicity result for $g$, will give termination
of the the procedure.

\begin{lemma}\guid{XZAJELF} If we have a match-core-list $(g,L,N)$,
then the number of elements that are final in $g$ is at most the number
of darts in $L$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  The set of elements that are final in $g$ injects into the
set of darts in the quotient.  Then apply ZBHENEI.
\end{proof}

The following lemma shows that when we terminate, the fgraph of $g$
will equal $L$.

\begin{lemma}\guid{XWCNBMA} If $(L,N,r,x)$ is a marked-list, 
and if every path of $N$
is a final-list, then $L$ is equal to its quotient-list by $N$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This is Example 4.51 (maximal normal family), translated into lists.
If $f$ is a loop in the family, it is canonically true.  Hence its
darts are singletons and the darts in the loop form a face.  Thus,
the set of darts visited by the family $N$ is a union of faces.

By the third, property of normal family, the set of darts visited by
the family $N$ is a union of nodes.  Hence the set of such darts is
a connected component. 

Part of the definition of marked-list gives that $(L,N)$ is a flag-list.  This implies
that the set of darts is a connected set,
so that all darts are visited by $N$.  
\end{proof}

%(Alternatively, we get the same conclusion if we assume that $N$ is obtained as a transform.  In this case,
%the flag-list condition, forces $N$ to be a connected set of faces, hence all of $L$.)

Thus, a series of transforms leads in a finite number of steps to a quotient-list that equals $L$.

\subsection{finals and nonFinals}

This section shows that showDups and hideDups are inverse operations, enum-of-VertexList and indexToVertexList are inverse
operations, mk-triple and dest-triple are inverse operations.  It analyzes containsDuplicateEdge and gives
an alternative to subdivFace.

\subsection{enumeration lists}



\subsection{index calculus of higher transforms}

We establish a common notation for the following lemmas.

Let $\iota(y,z,s)$ be the index of the dart $z$ in the list $s$ relative
to the base point $y$ (where both $y$ and $z$ are members of $s$).

\begin{lemma}\guid{QYHXIVZ}
\formalauthor{tchales, 2/2014} 
\formalnote{indexf-refl, indexf1, next-el-indexf, indexf-rotn, indexf-rotn, indexf-add-right, indexf-add-left, indexf-add-sum,
indexf-antisym, size-betwn, indexl-betwn, indexf-betwn-eq, next-eln-indexf, indexf-n, betwn-cases, indexf-add-betwn}
The index satisfies the following properties.  Assume
that $a,b,c$ are members of $s$, and that $s$ is uniq.  Let $n$ be the length of $s$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\iota(a,a,s)=0$.
\item $\iota$ is invariant under rotations of $s$.
\item $\iota(a,b,s) + \iota(b,c,s) = \iota(a,c,s)$ if $\iota(b,c,s)\le \iota(a,c,s)$.
\item $\iota(a,b,s) + \iota(b,c,s) = \iota(a,c,s)$ if $\iota(a,b,s)\le \iota(a,c,s)$.
\item $\iota(a,b,s) + \iota(b,c,s) = \iota(a,c,s)$ if $\iota(a,b,s)+\iota(b,c,s) < n$.
\item $\iota(a,b,s) + \iota(b,a,s) = n$, if $~(a=b)$.
\item $n^i a = b$, where $i=\iota(a,b,s)$ and $n$ is the next element map.
\item $\iota(a,b,s)=1$ iff $b$ is the next element after $a$ in $s$.
\item $b$ is between $a$ and $c$ on $s$ iff $a\ne c$ and $0 < \iota(a,b,s) < \iota(a,c,s)$.
\item We have one of the following: $b=a$, $b=c$, $b$ is between $a$ and $c$, or $b$ is between $c$ and $a$.
\item if $b$ is not between $c$ and $a$ on $s$, then $\iota(a,b,s) + \iota(b,c,s) = \iota(a,c,s)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\guid{FWDDPHY}
\formalauthor{tchales, 2/2014}
\formalnote{indexf-prev}   Assume that $b$ follows $a$ in $s$ and that $a\ne b$. Then
$\iota(b,a,s) + 1$ is the length of $s$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This is a special case of the preceeding lemma, since $\iota(a,b,s)=1$.
\end{proof}


Let $(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list.  Let $F$ be the face of $x$ in $L$.
 We let $w$ = $f x$ be the dart following $x$ in $F$.  It will serve
as a base point.

Let $T = T_{L,x}$ be the transform.  Set $(N_i,r_i) = T^i (N,r)$.  In particular,
$(N_0,r_0) = (N,r)$.   Let $y_i = l'y(L,r_i,x)$ and $z_i = l'z (L,N_i,r_i,x)$.
By construction $y_i$ and $z_i$ are members of $r_i$.
Also, let $z_i^-$ be the predecessor of $z_i$ in $r_i$ and $y_i^+$ the successor of
$y_i$ in $r_i$.

\begin{lemma}\guid{DANGEYJ}  Let $(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Then every dart of $N_i$ is a dart of $N_{i+1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The darts of $N_i$ in each face are the same in each face, except the face which is split.
Its darts are divided between the two new faces.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{PWSSRAT} 
Let $(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Then a dart $d$ of $r_i$ appears in $r_{i+1}$ if and only if $\iota(z_i,d,r_i)\le \iota(z_i,y_i,r_i)$.
\end{lemma}

(In particular, $z_i$ appears in $r_{i+1}$.)

\begin{proof} This follows from the explicit ordering of darts on faces and the transform.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\guid{OHCGKFU}
Let $(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Assume that $d$ is a dart in both $r_i$ and $r_{i+1}$.  Then 
\[
\iota(z_i,d,r_i) = \iota(z_i,d,r_{i+1}).
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This follows from the explicit ordering of darts on faces and the transform.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{PPLHULJ}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Then $y_i$ and $z_i$ belong to $F$, and
Then $\iota(w,y_i,F) < \iota(w,z_i,F)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This follows from the face map power applied to $y_i$ to obtain $z_i$,
an the result that $z_i$ is not in the s-list (HQYMRTX1).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{NCVIBWU}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
If $j\le \iota(w,z_i,F)$, then $f^jw$ belongs to $r_{i+1}$ and
$j = \iota(w,f^j w,r_{i+1})$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This follows from the explicit ordering of darts on faces and the transform.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{QCDVKEA}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Then $\iota(w,z_i,F) \le \iota(w,y_{i+1},F)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} By construction,  $\iota(w,y_{i+1},F)$ is the 
largest index $j$ such that the indexing on $f$ and $r_{i+1}$ agree up to $j$.
By the previous lemma, the indexing agrees at least up to $\iota(w,z_i,F)$.
\end{proof}

By PWSSRAT, $y_0$ belongs to $r_i$ for all $i$.

\begin{lemma}\guid{PBFLHET}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Let $d$ be a dart in $r_i$ such that
$\iota(w,z_i,r_i)\le \iota(w,d,r_i) \le \iota(w,y_0,r_i)$. Then $d$ belongs to $r$.
Moreover, $\iota(z_i,d,r_i) = \iota(z_i,d,r)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By assumption $d$ belongs to $r_i$.
Fix such a $d$.  By PWSSRAT, and the monotonicity of the parameters PPLHULJ and QCDVKEA,
by induction, $d$ belongs to $r_{i-j}$, for $j=0,\ldots,i$.  In particular, $d$ belongs to $r_0 = r$.

Taking $j=0$, we get $d=z_i$ belongs to $r$.

The index calculation is also backwards induction on indices $r_{i-j}$, using 
OHCGKFU.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{PNXVWFS}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
For all $i$, we have $y_i$ and $z_i$ belong to $r$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Apply the previous lemma to $d = y_{i+1}$ and $d=z_i$, which belong to $r_i$ by construction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{DIOWAAS}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Then $\iota(w,y_i,r) < \iota(w,z_i,r)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is equivalent to $\iota(z_i,w,r) \le \iota(z_i,y_i,r)$,  or to $\iota(z_i,w,r_i)\le \iota(z_i,y_i,r_i)$. 
For this it is enough to show that $w$ is not between $y_i$ and $z_i$ on $r_i$.  This is clear,
because the segment between $y_i$ and $z_i$ does not meet $r_{i+1}$, but $w$ belongs to $r_{i+1}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{RYIUUVK}
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
Then $\iota(w,z_i,r) \le \iota(w,y_{i+1},r)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  
The dart $y_{i+1}$ belongs to $r_{i+1}$.  We claim that it lies on the segment of $r_{i+1}$ between $z_i$ and $w$.
Otherwise, it is between $w$ and $z_i$.  But from $w$ to $z_i$, the list $r_{i+1}$ coincides with $f$, by NCVIBWU.  This is impossible,
since $y_{i+1}$ comes after $z_i$ on $f$.

On the segment of $r_{i+1}$ between $z_i$ and $w$, the ordering is the same as on $r$.
So $\iota(z_i,y_{i+1},r_{i+1}) < \iota(z_i,w,r_{i+1})$ gives $\iota(z_i,y_{i+1},r) < \iota(z_i,w,r)$ and hence
$\iota(w,z_i,r) \le \iota(w,y_{i+1},r)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{KBWPBHQ} 
$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
The set $\{y_i\}$ consists of darts $y$ such that
$y$ on $F$ and $N$ such that $y$ is followed by an 
$n^{-1}$-step on $r$.
The set $\{z_i\}$ consists of darts $z$ on $F$ and $N$ such that
$z$ is preceded by an $n^{-1}$-step on $r$.
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof}  We have seen that the darts $y_i$ and $z_i$ lie on $F$ and $r$.
By construction the darts $y_i$ are followed by an $n^{-1}$-step, and the darts
$z_i$ are preceded by an $n^{-1}$ step.

Conversely, let $y$ be any dart on $F$ and $N$ that is followed by an $n_{-1}$ step on $N$.
If $y$ is between $y_i$ and $z_i$, then these darts are not in $N_i$, hence not in $N$.  
This is contrary
to the assumption.

If $y$ is between $z_i$ and $y_{i+1}$, then $y$ is reached from $z_i$ by $f$-steps on $r_i$.
So they are also $f$-steps on $r$.
\end{proof}

%\begin{lemma}\guid{XBXFJPH}
%$(L,N,r,x)$ be a marked list with notation as established above.
%The darts on both  $F$ and $N$ all lie on the loop $L$.

\subsection{match $g$ $L$ and $N$}

\subsection{tame hypermaps}

The formalization of this section is complete.

\begin{lemma}\guid{OXAXUCS} 
\formalauthor{tch}
If a hypermap $H$ is isomorphic to one that has property
tame $k$, for $k\in \{9a, 10, 11a, 11b, 12o, 13a\}$, then
$H$ has that property as well.
\end{lemma} 

Each of the tame properties $I=\{9a,10,11a,11b,12o,13a\}$ has
a corresponding definition for lgraphs, say $I'$.  This correspondence is
defined in such as way that the following holds.

\begin{lemma}\guid{WMLNYMD}\formalauthor{tch}  Let $g$ be a good graph.  
Let $H$ be a tame hypermap that is isomorphic to the hypermap of $g$.
Then $g$ is tame.
\end{lemma} 

Let $H$ be any tame hypermap.  It is restricted, so there exists
a final planegraph $g$ and an isomorphism between $H$ and the
hypermap of $g$.  It follows that the hypermap of $g$ has all of
the tameness properties $I$.  Hence $g$ itself has all of the tameness
properties $I'$.  

By the Bauer-Nipkow formalization on tame graphs, $g$ is 
fgraph congruent
to an fgraph $y$ in the archive.

\begin{lemma}\guid{XRFJNDO}
\formalauthor{Solovyev}
\formalnote{See tame/good\_list\_archive.hl}
 Every member of the archive 
is a good-list.
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof} This is by direct enumeration of the archive.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\guid{ELLLNYZ}
\formalauthor{tch} 
Let $x$ and $y$ be two good-lists that are fgraph congruent.
Then their hypermaps are isomorphic, or the opposite hypermap of $x$
is isomorphic to the hypermap of $y$.
\end{lemma} 

Putting these results together we have that $H$ isomorphic to the
hypermap of $y$ or the opposite of $H$ is isomorphic to the hypermap
of $y$.

The main linear programming result, formalized by Solovyev, shows
that if $H$ is isomorphic to the hypermap of $y$, then it is not
contravening.  We need the opposite as well.

\begin{lemma}\guid{ASFUTBF}\formalauthor{tch}
 If the opposite of $H$ is contravening, then  $H$
is also contravening.  
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof}
  If $H$ is contravening, this means there is a finite packing $V$
  which is contravening and whose associated hypermap
  $\op{hyp}(V,E_{std}(V))$ is $H$.  The finite packing $-V$ obtained
  by negating all the coordinates is also contravening.  Its hypermap
  is isomorphic to the opposite of $H$.
\end{proof}
