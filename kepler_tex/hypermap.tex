\section{Background on Permutations}

\begin{definition} A \newterm{permutation} $f$ on a set $D$ is a bijection
$f:D\to D$.
\end{definition}

For example, the identity map $I_D$ on a set $D$,
\begin{displaymath}
I_D(x)=x \text{ for all } x \in D,
\end{displaymath}
 is a permutation.
If $f:D\to D$ is a permutation then there is an inverse function $f^{-1}:D\to D$
that is also a permuation.  
It satisfies
\begin{displaymath}
f f^{-1} = f^{-1} f = I_D.
\end{displaymath}
(This chapter uses product notation $f g$ for the composition of maps
$f\circ g$.)
If $D$ is a finite set, and two maps
$f,g:D\to D$ satisfy $f g = I_D$ on $D$, then $f$ and $g$ are permutations and are
inverses of one another:
\begin{displaymath}
f g = g f = I_D.
\end{displaymath}

Natural number powers  $f^k$ of a permutation $f:D\to D$ are defined
recursively by
\begin{displaymath}
f^0 = I_D,\quad\text{ and } f^{k+1} = f f^k.
\end{displaymath}
Integer powers $f^m$ of a permutation are defined as
$$f^m = f^i (f^{-1})^j,$$ where $m = i -j$.  This is well-defined.
The usual rule of exponents holds:
\begin{displaymath}
f^{a+b} = f^a f^b.
\end{displaymath}

If $f:D\to D$ is a permutation on a finite set $D$, then there is a smallest
positive integer $k$ such that $f^k=I_D$.  The integer $k$ is the \newterm{order}
of the permutation $f$.  If $f^m=I_D$ for any some $m$, then $m = k i$ for some
integer $i$, where $k$ is the order of $f$. The inverse $f^{-1} = f^k f^{-1} = f^{k-1}$ can be written as a
non-negative power of $f$.

A permutation $f$ of a finite set $D$ is \newterm{cyclic}, if the order of $f$ is the cardinality
of $D$.  A permutation $f$ is cyclic if and only if for every $x,y\in D$, there exists an integer $i$
such that $f^i x = y$.

The set of all permutations of the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots,k-1\}$ is written $\op{Sym}(k)$.
The set $\op{Sym}(k)$ is finite and has cardinality $k!$.



\section{Definitions}



\begin{definition}[hypermap,~dart]\label{def:hypermap}  
  A hypermap is a finite set $D$, together with three functions
  $e,n,f:D\to D$ whose composition is the identity:
  \begin{displaymath}
e\ocirc n\ocirc f = I_D.
\end{displaymath} The
elements of $D$ are called \newterm{darts}.  The functions $e,n$ and
$f$ are called the \newterm{edge map}, the \newterm{node map}, and
the \newterm{face map}, respectively.  \indy{Index}{hypermap}%

\begin{remark}\tlabel{rem:hypermap} A hypermap is an abstraction of
the concept of 
planar graph.  Place a dart at each angle of a planar graph.
One function, $f$, 
cycles counterclockwise around the angles of each face.  
Another function, $n$, 
rotates counterclockwise around the angles at each
node.  A third function, $e$, pairs angles at opposite ends of
each edge  (Figure~\ref{fig:hypermap_ex}).   The hypermap extracts
the data $(D,e,n,f)$ from the planar graph and discards the rest.

\label{fig:hypermap_ex}
\end{figure}

By the background on permutations, $e,n,f$ are all permutations on $D$.
A hypermap satisfies 
\begin{equation}\tlabel{eqn:triality}
e \ocirc n\ocirc f = n\ocirc f\ocirc e = f\ocirc e\ocirc n = I_D.
\end{equation}
Inverted, this triality becomes
\begin{displaymath}
n^{-1} \ocirc e^{-1} \ocirc f^{-1} = (f \ocirc e \ocirc n)^{-1} = I_D.
\end{displaymath}
This inversion is the abstract form of the the duality between nodes
and faces in a planar graph.  Because of these symmetries in the
defining relation, there will be multiple versions of theorems about
hypermaps, all obtained from one proof by symmetry.


\begin{definition}[path] 
Let $D$ be a set (of darts), and let $S$ be a set of permutations of $D$.
A \newterm{path} with \newterm{steps} in $S$
from $x_0$ to $x_{k-1}$ is a list\footnote{The empty path $[]$ seems
to have an ancient origin: ``This is the path made known to me
when I had learned to remove all darts.'' --The Dhammapada} of
darts $[x_0;x_1;\ldots;x_{k-1}]$ such that for each $i$, $x_{i+1} = h_i x_i$,
for some $h_i \in S$.    The
path is \newterm{injective} if $x_i=x_j$ implies $i=j$. 
The \newterm{dart set} of $L$ is $\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{k-1}\}$.  A path \newterm{visits}
a dart $x$, if $x$ is an element of the dart set of $L$.
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}[$::$,~$\opat$]
Write $P[x_i:x_j]$ for $i<j$ for the sublist $[x_{i+1};\ldots;x_j]$ of
$P=[x_0;\ldots;x_{k-1}]$.  (The notation is ambiguous when the path is
not injective.)  Write $x::P$ to prepend to a list:
$[x;x_0;\ldots;x_{k-1}]$.  Write $\opat$ for the concatenation of
lists:
\begin{displaymath}
[a;\ldots;b] \opat [c;\ldots;d]  = [a;\ldots;b;c;\ldots;d].

\begin{definition}[$\sim_S$]
Let $D$ be a set, and let $S$ be a 
set of permutations on $D$.
Define a relation on the set of darts by $x\sim y$ when there is a
path from $x$ to $y$ with steps in $S$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\guid{}\rating{50}\label{lemma:er} %\guid{QLPBIKV}
% wording changed by thales Jan 7, 2010.
Let $(D,e,n,f)$ be a hypermap and let $S$ be a  set of permutations.
Then for each $h_1,h_2\in S$, 
the relation $\sim_S$ is the same as the relation $\sim_T$, where
\begin{displaymath}
T = S \cup \{h_1h_2\}.
\end{displaymath}
Moreover, for each $h\in S$, 
the relation $\sim_S$ is the same as the relation $\sim_T$, where
\begin{displaymath}
T = S \cup \{h^{-1}\}.
\end{displaymath}
Also,  the relation $\sim_S$ (that is, $\sim_T$) is an equivalence relation.  
\indy{Index}{equivalence relation}%
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} If $x\sim_S y$ then clearly $x\sim_T y$.  Conversely,
if $x\sim_T y$, where $T = S\cup\{h_1,h_2\}$, pick a path $P$ from $x$ to $y$ with steps
in $T$ that contains the fewest $h_1h_2$-steps.  

\claim{$P$ does not contain any $h_1h_2$-steps}.  Otherwise, a sublist $[\ldots;u;h_1h_2u;\ldots]$
of $P$ can be expanded to a path $[\ldots;u;h_2u;h_1u;\ldots]$ that contradicts the minimal
property of $P$.

This proves the first conclusion of the lemma.  Fix $h$ in a set of permutations $R$.
By an induction that uses the first conclusion,  for all $i$, $\sim_R$ equals the relation $\sim_{R[h,i]}$,
where $R[h,i] = R \cup \{h,h^2,\ldots,h^i\}$.  If $h\in S$ is an element of order $k$, 
and $T = S\cup\{h^{-1}\}$, then
the second conclusion follows because the following sets give the same relation:
\begin{displaymath}
S,\quad S[h,k-1] = T[h,k-2],\quad T.
\end{displaymath}

By repeated action of the previous conclusion, $\sim_S=\sim_T$, where 
$T = S\cup S^{-1}\cup \{I_D\}$, and where $S^{-1} = \{h^{-1}\mid h\in S\}$.
The unit path $[x]$ yields reflexivity of $\sim_T$.  Also, $T^{-1} = T$ gives the symmetry.  Finally, composition of paths gives transitivity.  Thus, $\sim_T$ (i.e., $\sim_S$) is an equivalence relation.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[combinatorial~component,~connected]
A \newterm{combinatorial component} of a hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$ is an 
equivalence class of the relation $\sim_S$, where
$S=\{e,f,n\}$. 
(See Lemma~\ref{lemma:er} for other sets that define the same equivalence classes.)  
Write $\#c$ for the
number of combinatorial components.  The hypermap is \newterm{connected} if
$\#c=1$.  \indy{Index}{Dhammapada}%

\begin{definition}[orbit,~node,~face,~edge] The \newterm{orbit} of $x\in D$ under a permutation $h$ on
a set $D$ is a set of the form $\{h^i x\mid i\in\ring{N}\}$.  A \newterm{node}
of a hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$ is the orbit of a dart $x\in D$ under $n$.  
A \newterm{face} is an orbit under $f$.  
An \newterm{edge} is an
orbit under $e$.  \indy{Index}{node}%

Write $\#h$ for the
number of orbits of a permutation $h$ on $D$.

\indy{Notation}{1@$\#h$~(number of orbits)}%


\begin{lemma}
Let $D$ be a finite set.  The orbit of $x\in D$ of a permutation $h:D\to D$
is the equivalence class of $x$ under the relation $\sim_S$, when $S=\{h\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[plain] A hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$ is \newterm{plain}
  (carefully note\footnote{This deliberate play on the homophonous
    {\it plane} privileges writing over speech.  Every plane (hyper)graph may
be planar, but not all plain hypermaps are planar.}
  the  spelling!) when $e$ is an involution on $D$ (that is, $e^2 = I_D$).
  \indy{Index}{planar}%
\end{definition}




\begin{definition}[degenerate] A dart in a hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$ 
is degenerate if it is a
fixed point of one of the maps $e,n,f$; otherwise it is nondegenerate.  
%%It is nondegenerate otherwise.
\indy{Index}{dart!degenerate}%
\indy{Index}{dart!nondegenerate}%
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[simple] 
A hypermap is \newterm{simple} if the intersection of each face with
each node contains at most one dart.  \indy{Index}{simple}%
\end{definition}


% Moved from cup05_tame.tex section on tame plane graphs. 9/5/07:
\begin{lemma}\guid{ZHQCZLX}\rating{50}\tlabel{lemma:nondegen} 
Let $(D,e,n,f)$ be a simple plain hypermap such that every face has
at least three darts.
Then $n$ has no fixed point.
\indy{Index}{fixed point}%
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} For a contradiction, let $x$ be a fixed point of
$n$. 

\claim{The darts $e x$ and $f x$ lie in the same node and face, so are
equal in the simple hypermap.}  Indeed, they lie in the same node
because $n(f x) = e^{-1} x = e x$. They lie in the same face because
\begin{displaymath}f^2 (e x) = f (f e n x) = f x.\end{displaymath}
So $e x = f x$.

Thus, $f^2 (e x) = f x = e x$, and $e x$ lies on a
face with at most two darts.  This contradicts what is given.
\end{proof}




\section{Walkup}

To focus on a dart $x$ in a
hypermap, it can be useful to draw a hexagon around $x$ and place
the six darts $e x$,
$f x$, $e^{-1} x$, $n x$,  $f^{-1} x$, $e x$, $n^{-1} x$  at its corners
in Figure~\ref{fig:dart+}.  Some of these seven darts may be
equal to one another, even if the figure draws them apart.
Figure~\ref{fig:dart-fix} shows the layout of a degenerate dart.

\subsection{single}

A \newterm{walkup} deletes
a dart from a hypermap and reforms the edge, node, and face
maps to produce a hypermap on the reduced set of darts.  Walkups
come in three flavors: edge walkups, face walkups,
and node walkups.

\begin{definition}[walkup,~degenerate]
The edge \newterm{walkup}
$W_e$ at  a dart $x\in D$ of a hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$ is the hypermap
$(D',e',n',f')$, where $D' = D\setminus\{x\}$ and the
the maps skip over $x$:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lll}
f' y &= \text{ if } (f y =  x) \text{ then } f x \text{ else
} f y\\
n' y &= \text{ if } (n y = x) \text{ then } n x \text{ else
} n y\\
e' &= (n'\ocirc f')^{-1}
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
A walkup at $x$ is said to be \newterm{degenerate} if the dart $x$ is
degenerate.

\indy{Notation}{Wh@$W_h$ (walkup)}%
\end{definition}

Figure~\ref{fig:walk} shows
the result of an edge walkup on the hexagon around a dart $x$.
The triality symmetry~\ref{eqn:triality}, applied to the definition
of edge walkups, yields the definition of
face walkup $W_f$ and node walkup $W_n$.  
% Figure~\ref{fig:walkfn} shows the result of the face and node
% walkups on the hexagon around a dart $x$.

At a degenerate dart $x$, all three walkups are equal:
$W=W_e=W_n=W_f$ (Figure~\ref{fig:walkdegen}).

\begin{definition}[merge,~split]\tlabel{def:merge-split} 
Let $(D,e,n,f)$ be a hypermap, and let $h=n,e$, or $f$.  Let $\op{orbit}(h,x)$
denote the orbit of $x\in D$ under $h$.  Let $(D',e',n',f')$ be the hypermap obtained
from $(D,e,n,f)$ by the walkup $W_h$ at $x\in D$.
Let $h'=e',n',f'$, respectively, according to the choice of $h$.
The walkup $W_h$ at $x$ \newterm{merges} when the walkup joins the
orbit of $h$ through $x$ with another orbit.  That is, there is an orbit $O$ of some
$y\in D'$ under $h':D'\to D'$ of the form
\begin{displaymath}
O \cup\{x\} = \op{orbit}(h,x) \cup \op{orbit}(h,y),
\end{displaymath}
where $y\not\in \op{orbit}(h,x)$.
It \newterm{splits}
when the walkup splits the orbit at $x$ into two orbits.  That is, there are 
distinct orbits $O_1,O_2$ under $h'$ in the hypermap $(D',e',n',f')$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\{x\}\cup O_1\cup O_2 = \op{orbit}(h,x).

\begin{lemma}\guid{ZMFKZNH}\rating{150}\tlabel{lemma:merge-split} 
  Let $(D,e,n,f)$ be a hypermap and let $W_h$ be a nondegenerate
  walkup at a dart $x$.  Then $W_h$ merges or splits. Moreover, it merges if
  and only if $x$ and $y$ lie in distinct $h$-orbits, where
  $(h,y)=(f,e x)$,  $(e,n x)$, or $(n,f x)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The walkup $W_f$ splits if and only if $f x$ 
(or $x$)
and $e x$ lie in the same $f$-orbit before the split. 
Figure~\ref{fig:split} makes this clear.
The other cases $h=e,n$ hold by triality.
\end{proof}

\label{fig:split}
\end{figure}

The following is a useful way to tell if a walkup merges.


\begin{lemma}\guid{FKSNTKR}\rating{80}\tlabel{lemma:ng-merge}  
Suppose, in a simple plain hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$, that an edge $\{x,y\}$ consists
of two nondegenerate darts.  Then the walkup $W_f$ 
% (resp. $W_n$)  removed Jan 10, 2009.  Needed? Is it even true?
at $x$ merges.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{merge}%

\begin{proof} 
The darts $f x$ and $e x$ lie in the same node: $n (f x) = e^{-1} x
= e x$. If they are also in the same face of a simple hypermap, then
$f x = e x = y$. So
\begin{displaymath}n y  = n f x = n f e y = y,\end{displaymath}
and $y$ is a fixed
point of $n$, hence degenerate, contrary to assumption.  
Thus, $f x$ and $e x$ are in different faces, and the walkup merges
by Lemma~\ref{lemma:merge-split}.  
\end{proof}


\subsection{double}
\indy{Index}{walkup!double}%

A double walkup is the composite of two walkups of the same type.  The
two darts for the two walkups are to be the members of an orbit of
size two (under $n$, $e$, or $f$).
%%XX?The first walkup is to be chosen so that it merges.  
By choosing the type of the walkups to be different from the type of
the orbit, the first walkup reduces the orbit to a singleton, forcing
the second walkup to be degenerate.

Here are some examples.
\begin{itemize}
\item A double $W_n$ along an edge deletes the edge and 
merges the two endpoints into
a single node (Figure~\ref{fig:doublenode}). 
\item A double $W_f$ along an edge 
deletes the edge and merges the two faces along the edge into
one (Figure~\ref{fig:doubleface}).
\item A double $W_e$ at a node of degree two
deletes the node and merges the two edges at the node into
one (Figure~\ref{fig:doubleedge}).
\end{itemize}

\begin{lemma}\guid{HOZKXVW}\rating{150}\tlabel{lemma:dwalk-planar}  
The three preceding double walkups carry plain
hypermaps into plain hypermaps.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{hypermap!plain}%

\begin{proof} The walkups $W_n$ and $W_f$ preserve the orbit structure
of edges, except for dropping one dart.  By dropping both darts from
the same edge, one edge is lost and all others edges remain
unchanged.

Figure~\ref{fig:doubleplain} illustrates the double $W_e$.  The two
edges $\{x,e x\}$, $\{y, e y\}$ meeting the node are fused by the
double walkup into $\{e x, e y\}$, which is still an edge of size
two.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[reverse double walkup]\label{rem:reverse-double-walkup}
Double walkup transformations can be run in reverse.
Let $H'=(D',e',n',f')$ be
a hypermap and let $D\supset D'$ be a set that contains two additional elements
$x,y$.  Fix distinct elements $x',y'\in D'$.  Define $n,e:D\to D$ as follows.
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{cases} 
e x = y, &\\
e y = x,&\\
e z = z,&\text{otherwise.}\\
\end{cases}
\qquad\qquad
\begin{cases} 
n x' = x, &\\
n x =  n' x',&\\
n y' = y,&\\
n y =  n' y',&\\
n z = n' z, &\text{otherwise.}\\
\end{cases}
\end{displaymath}
Define $f$ by forcing the hypermap identity $e n f = I_D$.  
The edge $\{x,y\}$ has been inserted by a reverse double walkup.  The insertion points of the edge
into the hypermap
depend on the data $\{(x',x),(y',y)\}$.   Reverse double walkup transformations that
insert a node $\{x,y\}$ or a face $\{x,y\}$ into a hypermap are obtained similarly  by triality symmetry.

\begin{definition}[planar]  A hypermap is \newterm{planar} (note the
spelling!) when the Euler relation holds:
\begin{displaymath}\# n + \# e + \# f = \# D + 2\, \#c.\end{displaymath}
\indy{Index}{planar}%
\end{definition}


\begin{remark}\label{rem:Euler}   
The Euler relation for planar graphs can be translated into the
language of hypermaps.  Consider a connected planar graph that
satisfies the Euler relation for the alternating sum of Betti
numbers:
\begin{displaymath}b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 2\end{displaymath} where $b_0$
is the number of vertices, $b_1$ the number of edges, and $b_2$ the
number of faces (including an unbounded face) of the planar
graph. The hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$, made from the planar graph in
Remark~\ref{rem:hypermap}, is plain, and the involution $e$ has no fixed points.  
Thus, $\# D = 2\#e$, according to the partition of $D$ into edges.  Moreover,
\begin{displaymath}\begin{array}{lll}
b_0 &= \# n\\
b_1 &= \# e\\
b_2 &= \# f\\
2b_1 &= \# D\\
1 &= \#c\\
b_0 - b_1 + b_2  &= \# n + (\#e - \#D) + \# f = 2\,\# c.
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Thus, the hypermap is also planar.

\begin{lemma}\guid{TGJISOK}\rating{80}\label{lemma:dart-upper} 
Let $H$ be a connected plain planar hypermap such that every edge
has cardinality two.  Assume that there are at least three darts in
every node.  Then
\begin{displaymath}
\# D \le (6\, \#f - 12).
\end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}
\indy{Notation}{H@$H$ (hypermap)}%

\begin{proof}  In a plain planar hypermap, the Euler relation becomes
\begin{displaymath}6\, \#f - 12 = 3\,\#D - 6\,\#n,\end{displaymath}
so it is enough to show that
\begin{displaymath}
\# D \ge 3\,\#n.
\end{displaymath}
This follows directly by assumption: the set of darts can be
partitioned into nodes, with at least three darts per node.
\end{proof}

and $\op{split}_c=1$ if $e x$ and $f^{-1} x$ belong to different

\begin{lemma}\guid{BISHKQW}\rating{100}\tlabel{lemma:planar-index2}
Let $\iota$ be the index of a hypermap $(D,e,n,f)$, and let $\iota'$
be the index after a walkup $W_h$ at a dart $x$.  Then $\iota \le
\iota'$.
\end{lemma} 


\begin{proof} Without loss of generality, by triality symmetry, the
walkup is a face walkup.  If $\op{split}_c=0$, the inequality is
immediate by Lemma~\ref{lemma:index}.  If $\op{split}_c=1$, 
then $e x$ and $f^{-1} x$ lie in
different components after the walkup, hence also in different
faces.  Thus, the walkup splits by Lemma~\ref{lemma:merge-split}.
Hence  $\op{split}_f = 1$.  The result
follows by Lemma~\ref{lemma:index}.

\begin{lemma}\guid{FOAGLPA}\rating{50}\tlabel{lemma:planar-nonpos}  
The planar index
of a hypermap is never positive.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  An face walkup never decreases the index.  A sequence
of face walkups leads to the empty hypermap, which has
index zero.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\guid{SGCOSXK}\rating{50}\tlabel{lemma:walkup-planar}
Walkups take planar hypermaps to planar
hypermaps.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  
A planar hypermap has maximum index.  The walkup
can only increase the index, but never beyond its maximum.  
Thus, the index remains at its maximum value.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[cyclic~list]
A \newterm{cyclic list} $\lp{x_0;\ldots;x_{k-1}}$ is an equivalence class of lists under the transitive closure of the relation:

[x_0;x_1;x_2\ldots;x_{k-1}] \sim [x_1;x_2;\ldots;x_{k-1};x_0].
\end{displaymath}
A sublist of a cyclic list is a sublist of some representative of the equivalence class.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[contour~path,cyclic~list,~contour~loop] A \newterm{contour path} from
$x_0$ to $x_{k-1}$ is a path $[x_0;x_1;\ldots;x_{k-1}]$ such that
$x_{i+1} = n^{-1} x_i$ or $f x_i$ for each $i<k$.  (That is, each
step in the path is clockwise step around a node or a
counterclockwise step around a face.)  
A \newterm{contour loop} is an injective cyclic list
$\lp{x_0;x_1;\ldots;x_{k-1}}$ such that

\begin{remark} Figure~\ref{fig:hypermap_ex} constructs a hypermap from
a planar graph by drawing darts next to each angle.  In this
representation, the darts along a contour path lie to the left of
the corresponding planar graph edges.  For that reason, a shaded
region to the left of a curve depicts a contour path.

Let $H$ be a hypermap.
If $x$ and $y$ are darts in the same combinatorial component of $H$ if and only if
there exists a contour path from $x$ to $y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
Combinatorial components are defined by an equivalence relation $\sim_S$, where
$S = \{e,n,f\}$.  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:er}, this is the same equivalence relation as
$\sim_T$, where $T = \{n^{-1},f\}$.  By the definition of the equivalence relation $T$,
$x\sim_T y$ if and only if there is a contour path from $x$ to $y$.

Concatenate these new sublists in reverse order.  By the relation $n f = f^{-1} n^{-1}$,
the transitions between the new sublists are $f$-steps.

\begin{definition}[M\"obius~contour] A M\"obius contour in a hypermap
$(D,e,n,f)$ is an

G. Gonthier devised the notion of M\"obius contour as a way to prove

\begin{lemma}\guid{LIPYTUI}\rating{300}\tlabel{lemma:no-mobius}
A planar hypermap does not have a M\"obius contour.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Index}{hypermap!planar}%

\begin{proof} For a contradiction, assume that there exist planar
hypermaps with M\"obius contours.  An edge walkup carries
planar hypermaps into planar hypermaps. An edge walkup
at a dart that is not on the M\"obius contour carries the
M\"obius contour to a M\"obius contour 
and reduces the number of darts.  
In the M\"obius Condition~\ref{eqn:mobius},
a walkup at a dart that is not at position $0$, $i$, $j$, $k$
along the contour carries the M\"obius contour to a M\"obius contour
and reduces the number of darts. Thus, a counterexample with
the smallest possible number of darts contains no
darts except those on the M\"obius contour, and its only darts
are at positions $0$, $i=j=1$, $k=2$.

This is a three darted hypermap (Figure~\ref{fig:3m}.)  
The M\"obius condition, the
definition of contours, together with $e\ocirc n\ocirc f=I_D$ force
$e=n=f$, all permutations of order three.  This hypermap is not planar:
\begin{displaymath}\# e + \# n + \# f = 3~~\ne~~ 5 = \# D + 2\,
\#c.\end{displaymath}

Suppose that a hypermap has no M\"obius contours. Let $L$ be a

\begin{proof} The proof shows the contrapositive.  Suppose $P=[n x;f n
x;\ldots;n y;y]$.  The successor of $n x$ on $L$ is $x$.  Starting
at $x$, follow $L$ to $y$, and on to $n x$.  Follow $P$ back to $n

\begin{displaymath}
x::L[x:n x] \opat P[ n x;ny].
\end{displaymath}  
This is a M\"obius contour $x\ldots y\ldots n x\ldots n y$.

Suppose $P=[n x;x;\ldots;f^{-1} y;y]$.  Starting at $x$, follow $P$ to
$y$, then follow $L$ to $n x$, and on to $n y$.  This is a M\"obius
contour.\footnote{The second statement can also be deduced from the first statement
by the duality $(D,e,n,f)\leftrightarrow (D,e^{-1},f^{-1},n^{-1})$ that swaps
$f$-steps with $n^{-1}$-steps in a path.}

\begin{definition}[normal family]
Let $(D,e,n,f)$ be a hypermap. 
%Assume that 
%there are no darts fixed by $e$ 
%(so that $f x \ne n^{-1} x$ at each dart). 
Let $\cal L$ be a family of contour
loops.  The family $\cal L$ is  normal if the following
conditions hold of its loops. \begin{enumerate}
\item  No dart is visited by two different loops.
\item  Every loop visits at least two nodes.
\item  If a loop visits a node, then every dart at that node is visited
by some loop.
\end{enumerate}
\indy{Index}{normal family}%

A normal family determines a new hypermap.  A dart in the new set $D'$
of darts is a maximal sublist $[x;n^{-1} x; n^{-2} x;\ldots;n^{-k}
x]$ of $n^{-1}$ steps appearing in some loop in $\cal L$. The map $f'$
takes the maximal path $[x;n^{-1}x;\ldots;y]$ to the maximal path (in
the same contour loop) starting at $f y$. The map ${n'}^{-1}$ takes
the maximal path $[\ldots;y]$ to the maximal sequence (in some other
contour loop) starting $[n^{-1}y;\ldots]$. Equivalently, $n'$ takes
the maximal path $[x;\ldots]$ to the maximal path ending $[\ldots;n
x]$. The map $e'$ is defined by $e'\ocirc n'\ocirc f' = I_{D'}$.

Let ${\cal L}$ be a normal family of the hypermap $H$.  Then ${\cal L}$ is in
natural bijection with the set of faces
of the quotient $H/{\cal L}$.  If $x'=[x;\ldots;n^{-k}x]$ is a maximal path of $n^{-1}$ steps in
the contour loop
$L\in{\cal L}$, then the corresponding face $F(L)$ of $H/{\cal L}$ is the one containing the
quotient dart $x'$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  This is left as an exercise to the reader.

\begin{example}[maximal normal family]\label{ex:Hall} 
Assume that $H=(D,e,n,f)$ is a hypermap. % with no fixed points under $e$. 
Assume that every face meets at least two nodes. Then the set of all faces
defines a normal family of contour loops: follow $f$ around each
face $[x;f x;\ldots]$.  If $e$ acts without fixed points, then each dart of the quotient is just a
unit path consisting of a single dart of $H$, and the quotient
is isomorphic to $H$ itself.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[minimal normal family]\label{ex:H2} 
  Assume that $H=(D,e,n,f)$ is a plain hypermap.  Let $F = \{x,f x,\ldots\}$ be a face
  that visits at least three nodes and that meets each node in at most

two faces: $F$ and a back side $F'$ of the same cardinality $k$.

\begin{example}[cyclic]\label{ex:H2k} 
There is a hypermap $H_{2k}$ with two face.  The set of darts is the
disjoint union of two copies of $Z_k$, a cyclic group of order $k$
with generator $1$.  Each cyclic group is a face.  Use the variable
$i$ to index the first cyclic group and $i'$ to index the second.
The face map is $i\mapsto i+1$ and $i'\mapsto (i-1)'$.  The node map
is the involution $i\leftrightarrow i'$.  The edge map is the
involution $i\leftrightarrow (i+1)'$.  The relation $e\ocirc n\ocirc

e n f (i') & e n (i-1)' & e (i-1) &= i'.\\

\begin{lemma}[plain quotient]\guid{JMKRXLA}\rating{280}\tlabel{lemma:quotient-plain}
Let $H$ be a plain hypermap, and let $\cal L$ be a
normal family.  Then $H/{\cal L}$ is a plain hypermap.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}  Write $H=(D,e,n,f)$ and $H/{\cal L} = (D',e',n',f')$.  
Write $[\ldots; x]$ for the node in
the quotient ending in dart $x\in D$ and $[x;\ldots]$ for the node
in the quotient starting with dart $x\in D$.  Plainness gives $e^2 x
= x$, so that for any dart $[\ldots x]$ in the quotient:
\begin{displaymath}\begin{array}{lll}
{e'}^{-2} [\ldots; x] &= n' f' n' f' [\ldots; x] = n' f' n' [f x; \ldots] \\&=
n' f' [\ldots; n f x] = n' [f n f; \ldots] = [\ldots; n f n f x]\\ &=
[\ldots; e^{-2} x] = [\ldots; x].
\end{array}\end{displaymath}
Thus, $e'$ has order $2$ on the quotient.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:nfp}
Let $H=(D,e,n,f)$ be a hypermap in which the edge map has no fixed points.
Let ${\cal  L}$ be a normal family of $H$, with quotient $H/{\cal L} = (D',e',n',f')$.  
Then the following are equivalent conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $n'$ has a fixed point in $D'$.
\item The dart set of some $L\in {\cal L}$ contains a node.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If $x'=[x;n^{-1} x;\ldots;n^{-k} x]$ is a dart in $D'$, then $(n')^{-1}x'$ is
$[n^{-(k+1)} x;\ldots]$.  The dart $x'$ is a fixed point if and only if
$x = n^{-(k+1)} x$.  This holds if and only if the dart set of $x'$ is an entire node.

%\begin{lemma}[three darts]
%Let $H$ be a plain hypermap with no multiple joins in which every
%face has at least three darts.  Let ${\cal L}$ be a node-free normal family of $H$.
%Then every face of $H/{\cal L}$ has at least three darts.
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}  By definition, every contour loop in a normal family meets
%at least two nodes.  It follows that every face of $H/{\cal L}$ has at least two
%darts.
%
%Suppose for a contradiction that a face of $H'=H/{\cal L}$ only has two darts $x'$
%and $y'$, exchanged by the face map $f'$ of $H'$:
%\begin{displaymath}
%\begin{array}{lllll}
%y' &= [y;n^{-1} y;\ldots; n^{-k} y] &= f' x' &= [f n^{-\ell} x;\ldots;f x],\\
%x' &= [x;n^{-1}x;\ldots; n^{-\ell} x] &= f' y' &= [f n^{-k} y;\ldots; f y].\\
%\end{array}
%\end{displaymath}
%Using the relation $e^{-1} = n f$, it follows that $\{n^{-\ell} x, n y\}$
%and $\{n^{-k} y, n x\}$ are edges.  Both meet the node of $x$ and the node of $y$.
%In a hypermap with no mutiple joins, this implies that the edges are equal:
%\begin{displaymath}
%n y = n^{-k} y,\qquad n x = n^{-\ell} x.
%\end{displaymath}
%This shows that the dart set of $x'$ is the entire node.  This contradicts
%the assumption that ${\cal L}$ is node-free.
%\end{proof}
%

%\begin{lemma}\guid{ZOKKAOI}\tlabel{lemma:quotient-planar}
%Let $H$ be a plain planar hypermap, and let $\cal L$

%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof} Suppose $H/{\cal L}$ is not planar.
%Let $P$ be a M\"obius contour on $H/{\cal L}$.  It lifts uniquely to
%a contour on $H$ with the property that the darts visited on $H$ are
%precisely the darts that belong to a dart in the quotient.  This is
%compatible with the node map $n$.  So the contour path lifts to a

\subsection{flag}
\indy{Index}{flag}%

The remainder of the chapter presents an algorithm that generates all
simple, plain, planar hypermaps satisfying certain general conditions
(Definition~\ref{def:restricted}).  The algorithm proceeds by adding
edges and nodes to a hypermap by reverse double walkup
transformations.

The algorithm  marks certain faces as `true.'
Roughly, this  means that the the face cannot be modified
at any later stage of the algorithm.   When all of its faces
are true, the hypermap stands in final form.
The function that marks each face as true or false is a
\newterm{flag}.  For the algorithm to work properly, it is necessary
to impose some constraints, as captured in Definition~\ref{def:flag}.

\begin{definition}[flag]\label{def:flag} 
Let $S$ be a set of darts in a hypermap $H$.  An
$S$-\newterm{flag} on $H$ is a boolean-valued function on the set of faces that satisfies
the following two constraints. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item If darts $x,y$ belong to true faces,
then there is a contour path from $x$ to $y$ that remains
in true faces.
\item Each edge of the hypermap meets a true face or $S$.
\end{enumerate}
An $\emptyset$-flag is simply called a flag.

\begin{example}[cyclic hypermap flag] 
The cyclic hypermap of Example~\ref{ex:H2k}, carries a
flag that marks one face true and the other false.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[maximal quotient flag]\label{ex:Hall-flag} 
Let $H$ be a connected hypermap, and let $\cal L$ be the example of
Example~\ref{ex:Hall}, then the canonical map takes value
$\op{true}$ on every face.  This is a flag. In fact,
Lemma~\ref{lemma:connect-contour} provides the contour paths that
are required in the definition of flag.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[canonical boolean function] Let $H/{\cal L}$ be a
quotient hypermap with normal family $\cal L$.  The
\newterm{canonical boolean function} on the set of faces of the
quotient is the function that is true exactly when every quotient dart in the
face is a unit path $[x]$ in $H$.  
\indy{Index}{function!canonical boolean}%
\end{definition}

In other words, the face in the quotient is canonically true, exactly when the corresponding
contour loop $L\in {\cal L}$ has no $n^{-1}$ steps.  The dart set of such
a contour loop is a face of $H$.  Based on this observation, we make the following definition.

\begin{definition}[face specific]
A contour loop $L$ in a hypermap is \newterm{face specific} if its dart set is a face of $H$.
\end{definition}


\begin{lemma}[quotient isomorphism criterion]\guid{STKBEPH}\rating{100}\tlabel{lemma:all-dart}  
  Let $H$ be a hypermap in which $e$ acts without fixed points, and
  let ${\cal L}$ be a normal family of $H$. If the canonical boolean
  function on the set of faces of $H/{\cal L}$ has at least as many
  true values as there are faces of $H$, then $\cal L$ is the normal
  family in Example~\ref{ex:Hall}. In particular, $H/{\cal L}$ is
  isomorphic to $H$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} If a face of  $H/{\cal L}$ is $\op{true}$,  then
its darts are unit paths, and the face of $H/{\cal L}$ is in natural
bijection with a face in $H$.  This is an injective map from the
set of true faces of $H/{\cal L}$ to the set of faces of $H$.  The
hypothesis of the lemma implies that this injective map is
bijective. All of the darts of $H$ are accounted for under this
bijection. Thus, the quotient has no false faces.  The result
follows.
\end{proof}

There is a standard way of constructing the sets $S$ of darts that
will be used in $S$-flags.  We call a set $S$ arising in this
standard way a \newterm{flag set}.

\begin{definition}[flag set]
Let $H$ be a hypermap, $L$ a contour loop of the hypermap,
and $x$ an element of the dart set of $L$.
If  $L$ is  face specific, then let $S=\emptyset$.
Otherwise,
let $m\ge0$ to be the largest $m$ 
such that 
\begin{displaymath}
[x;f x; f^2 x;\ldots;f^{m+1} x]
\end{displaymath}  
is a sublist of $L$, and
%Set $y = f^{m+1} x$
set $S = S(H,L,x) = \{f^i x \mid 1 \le i\le m\}$.
The set $S$ is called the \newterm{flag set} of $(H,L,x)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[flag set quotient]\label{lemma:flag-set-quotient}
Let $H$ be a hypermap in which $e$ acts without fixed points, 
$L$ a contour loop, and $x$ and element of the dart set of $L$.
Let ${\cal L}$ be a normal family of $H$ that contains $L$.
Then $S(H,L,x)$ maps bijectively to a set $S'$ of darts in the quotient $H/{\cal L}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The darts of the quotient are maximal sublists $[y;n^{-1} y;\ldots;n^{-k} y]$
of contour loops $L'\in {\cal L}$ made entirely of $n^{-1}$ steps.  
Each $y\in S(H,L,x)$ is preceded by an $f$-step and is
followed by an $f$-step in $L$.  Hence the maximal sublist of $L$ containing $y$ 
is a unit path $[y]$.  The
bijection follows.
\end{proof}

  This example illustrates the markup (Figure~\ref{fig:graph-gen}).  In
  the figure, the hypermap $H$ is represented as a planar graph.  The
  contour loops are represented by left-side shadings of the edges of
  the planar graph.  The shaded edges give the edges of a planar graph
  representing the quotient.  The function $\varphi'$ is the canonical
  boolean function.  The polygons that are fully shaded are true.  Two
  polygons in the quotient are false.  A dart of $H$ in a false contour loop
   $L$ in $H'$ is marked $x$.  By inspection,  $S(H,L,x)=\{f
  x,f^2 x,f^3 x\}$.  By inspection, $\varphi'$ is an $S'$-flag, where
  $S'$ is the image of $S$ in the quotient.  (In fact, the darts in true faces
  form a connected region.  Every edge in the quotient except  $\{f' x', e' f'

\begin{lemma}\guid{HQYMRTX}\rating{200} \label{lemma:yz}
Let $(H,{\cal L},L,x,\varphi)$ be a marked hypermap.
Assume that  $L$ is not face specific. % face specific assumption not needed.
Set  $y = f^{m+1} x$, where $m = \card(S(H,L,x))$.
  Set
$z=f^{p+1} y$, where $p$ is the smallest natural number 
%Then there is a smallest $p\ge0$,
such that some contour loop in ${\cal L}$ visits $f^{p+1} y$.
Then, $L$ visits $z$, and $z\ne f^k x$ when $0 < k \le {m+1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
  For a contradiction, suppose $f^{p+1} y = f^k x$, for some $0<k\le
  m+1$.  Then also, $f^p y = f^{k-1} x$.  If $p>0$, then this
  contradicts the minimality of $p$.   (Note that $L$ visits $f^{k-1}x$ by the
definition of flag set and $m$.)  So $p=0$, and $y=f^{k-1} x =
  f^{m+1} x$.  Also, $0\le k-1 < {m+1}$, which implies that the face of $x$ has size at
most $m+1$.  This  forces $L$ to be face
  specific, which is contrary to assumption.  This proves the second
  conclusion of the lemma.  In particular, $z\not\in S$, where $S =
  S(H,L,x)$.

Let $L'$ be the contour loop of ${\cal L}$ that visits $z$.  For a contradiction,
assume that $L'\ne L$.

\claim{$L'$ is false.}  Otherwise, $L'$ is true with respect to the
canonical flag and it therefore a loop consisting entirely of
$f$-steps.  In particular, $L'$ visits $z,x$, and $y$.  This is
contrary, to the assumption that the contour loop containing $x$ is
false.

Let $H' = (D',e',n',f') = H/{\cal L}$, and let $S'$ be the image of $S$ in $D'$.
Let $z' = [\ldots;u]\in D'$ be the
image of $z$ in $D'$.    
As $z\not\in S$, we also have $z'\not\in S'$.
By the definition of
$S'$-flag, the dart $e'z'$ lies in a true face or $e'z'\in S'$.  
This disjunction splits
splits the proof into two cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\claim{[$e'z'$ lies in a true face.]}  In this case, 
\begin{displaymath}
e'z' = f^{-1} n^{-1} [\ldots,u] = f^{-1} [n^{-1}u;\ldots],
\end{displaymath}
so that $n^{-1} u$ is visited by a true contour loop.
Consider the following
path in $H$:
\begin{displaymath}
[y;fy;\ldots;z] @ [n^{-1}z;\ldots;u] @ [n^{-1} u;\ldots;n^{-1} x].
\end{displaymath}
The first segment consists of $f$-steps; the second of $n^{-1}$-steps;
and the third segment exists within true contour loops of ${\cal L}$
by the connectedness of true faces (by properties of flags).  This
path satisfies all the assumptions of Lemma~\ref{lemma:contour-f}.  (In particular,
the node of $n f x$ (or of $f x$)  is distinct from the node of $x$ by the
assumed simplicity of the quotient $H/{\cal L}$.)
The lemma asserts that the path does not exist.
\item 
\claim {[$e'z'\in S$.]}  In this case,  
$f^{-1}n^{-1}u \in S$ and $L$ visits $n^{-1} u$ at the node of $z$.
Consider the following path of $f$-steps in $H$:
\begin{displaymath}
[y;f y;\ldots;z].
\end{displaymath}
This path satisfies all the enumerated conditions of
Lemma~\ref{lemma:contour-f}.  (In particular, $y$ and $z$ are at
different nodes by the assumed simplicity of the quotient $H/{\cal
  L}$.)  The lemma asserts that the path does not exist.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}[transform]
  From one marked hypermap $(H,{\cal L},L,x,\varphi)$ in which $L$ is
  not face specific, we construct a new tuple
\begin{displaymath}
T(H,{\cal L},L,x,\varphi) = (H,{\cal M},L_1,x,\psi),
\end{displaymath}
 called the \newterm{transform} of
  $(H,{\cal{L}},L,x,\varphi)$.  
As the notation indicates, the hypermap $H$ and the dart $x$ are the same for both
tuples.  The data ${\cal M}$, $L_1$, and $\psi$ are specified in
the following paragraphs.
\end{definition}

Let $m$, $p$, $y$, and $z$ be as given in
Lemma~\ref{lemma:yz}.
Set
\begin{displaymath}
L_1 = \lp{L[x:y] \opat P[y:z] \opat L[z:x]},
\end{displaymath}
the contour loop in $H$ that follows $L$ from $x$ to $y$, then takes
$f$-steps from $y$ to $z$, then continues along $L$ back to $x$.  
Set 
\begin{displaymath}
L_2 = \lp{L[n^{-1}y:n z] \opat P^c[n z:n^{-1}y]},
\end{displaymath}
the contour loop in $H$ that follows $L$ from $n^{-1} y$ to $n z$,
then complements the path of $L_1$ from $y$ to $z$, traveling instead
from $n z$ to $n^{-1} y$. 


Set
\begin{displaymath}{\cal M} = ({\cal L}\setminus \{L\}) \cup
\{L_1,L_2\}.\end{displaymath}

Define a boolean function $\psi$
on $\cal M$ to be true on the face-specific contour loops, and to be
false otherwise.
(Once we verify that ${\cal M}$ is a
normal family,  $\psi$ gives the canonical function $\psi'$ on
the faces of the quotient $H/{\cal M}$.)  
Since the restrictions of $\varphi$ and $\psi$ to ${\cal L}\cap {\cal M}$
are equal,  there is no ambiguity in referring to a given contour loop
in ${\cal L}\cup {\cal M}$ as true or false, without reference to $\varphi$ or
$\psi$.

\begin{lemma}[transform]\guid{AQIUNPP}\rating{600}\tlabel{lemma:flag} 
Let $H$ be a restricted hypermap.
If $(H,{\cal L},L,x,\varphi)$ is a marked hypermap such that $L$
is not face specific,  then the transform
$(H,{\cal M},L_1,x,\psi)$ 
is also a marked hypermap.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Let 
\begin{displaymath}
H=(D,e,n,f),\   H' =(D',e',n',f') = H/{\cal
    L},\  H'' = (D'',e'',n'',f'') = H/{\cal M}.   
\end{displaymath}
Let $S'$ be the image of $S(H,L,x)$ in $D'$.  Let $y,z$ be the darts
constructed in Lemma~\ref{lemma:yz} from the marked hypermap $(H,{\cal
  L},L,x,\varphi)$.  The dart $z$ is not at the same node as $y$ (by
the simplicity of $H$).

  The proof can be organized into independent parts, according to the separate
  properties of a marked hypermap.  The first part of the proof
  establishes that ${\cal M}$ is a normal family.


\case{normal-1} \claim{No dart is visited by two different loops.}
Indeed by construction, the sets of darts of $L_1$ and $L_2$
are disjoint from each other and disjont from the sets of darts of $L'\in
{\cal L}\setminus \{L\}$.  The result now follows from the normality of  ${\cal L}$.

\case{normal-2} \claim{Every loop visits at least two nodes.}  Indeed, this
is true for $L_1$ and $L_2$ because they visit the nodes of $y$ and
$z$.  It is true of the other loops because they belong to the
normal family ${\cal L}$. 

\case{normal-3} \claim{If a loop visits a node, then every dart at
that node is visited by some loop.} 
% Indeed, the new nodes visited on the
%sublist of $L_1$ from $y$ to $z$ do not contain any darts in any
%loop in ${\cal L}$.  (By the definition of normal family, if a loop
%visits a node, then every dart at that node is visited by some loop
%of ${\cal L}$.)  These new nodes contain two darts, with one dart
%along $L_1$ and the other along $L_2$.  The paths $L_1$ and $L_2$
%visit every dart visited by $L$.  They visit every dart at the nodes
%of $y,\ldots,z$.
Indeed, the nodes that are visited by some loop in ${\cal M}$ are
precisely those visited by some loop in ${\cal L}$, together with the
``new'' nodes; that is, the nodes of $f y,\ldots,f^p y$.  The set of
darts that are visited by some loop of ${\cal M}$ is the union of the
set visited by loops in ${\cal L}$, together with two darts at the
new nodes.  As each new nodes has only two darts, and as ${\cal L}$ itself
it normal, the result follows. It follows that ${\cal M}$ is normal.  


\case{simple} To prove the simplicity of the quotient, it is enough to show that
none of the contour
loops in ${\cal M}$  ever return to a node after leaving it.
 (More precisely, the dart set of any $L'\in{\cal M}$ intersected with a node
is the dart set of a maximal sublist $[z;n^{-1}z;\ldots;n^{-k}z]$ of $n^{-1}$ steps.)
This is true of $L'\in{\cal L}\setminus\{L\}$ by assumption and true of
$L_1$ and $L_2$ by construction.  Simplicity follows.

\case{fixed-point free} By Lemma~\ref{lemma:nfp}, to prove that $n''$
does not have a fixed-point, it is enought to show that no loop in
${\cal M}$ has a dart set containing a node.  It is sufficient to
consider the loops $L_1$ and $L_2$.  The set of darts of $L_1$ and
$L_2$ at the old nodes (that is, those not meeting $\{f y,\ldots,f^p
y\}$) are subsets of the set of darts of $L$ at those nodes.  As the
dart set of $L$ does not contain an old node, neither do $L_1$ and
$L_2$.  At the new nodes, $L_1$ and $L_2$ both have at least one dart,
so neither contains the entire node.  It follows that $n''$ is
fixed-point free.

\claim{$e'y'\not\in S'$, where $y'$ is the image of $y$ in $H'$. }
Otherwise, write $y' = [y;n^{-1}y;\ldots;u]$, a sublist of $L$, and
pick $k$ such that $e'y' = [f^k x]\in S'$.  Then
\begin{displaymath}
(n')^{-1} y' = f'e'y' = f'[f^k x] = [f^{k+1}x;\ldots].
\end{displaymath}
By the construction of $S(H,L,x)$, we know that $L$ visits $f^{k+1}x$.
Hence $y'$ and $(n')^{-1}y'$ both lie in the same node and in the same
face $F(L)$.  By the simplicity of $H'$, it follows that $y' =
(n')^{-1} y'$.  That is, $y'$ is a fixed point of $n'$.  This is contrary to
assumption. The claim follows.


\claim{$e'y'$ lies in a true face of $H'$.}  Indeed,
 since $\varphi'$ is
an $S'$-flag on $H'$, the edge $\{y',e'y'\}$ meets a true face or
$S'$.  However, $y'\not\in S'\subset F(L)$, by the simplicity of $H$.  Also,
$e'y'\not\in S'$, by the previous paragraph.
The dart $y'$ lies in the false face $F(L)$.  The only
remaining possibility is that $e'y'$ lies in a true face.  



\case{flag-1} \claim{The true faces of $H''$ are
  connected.}  Indeed,  $L_1$ is connected to a true face
by the contour path $[x;n^{-1} x]$, because $n^{-1} x$ lies
in the same face as $n f x$, which is a true face by assumption.
If $L'\in{\cal M}\setminus\{L_1,L_2\}$ is a true, then $L'\in  {\cal L}$, and
it connects with the true faces of ${\cal L}$ as before.
If $L_2$ is true, then the proof requires more
argument.   Write $y'=[y;\ldots;u]$ as above.
The dart $u''=[n^{-1}y;\ldots;u]$ of $H''$ lies in the face $F(L_2)$.
Also, 
\begin{displaymath}
(n'')^{-1} u''= [n^{-1} u;\ldots] = [f e u;\ldots] = f'' [\ldots; e u]
  = f'' e' y'
\end{displaymath}
Thus, we have a contour path from $u''$ to $e'' y'$, which lies in a
true face, by an earlier claim.  (The dart $e'y'$ is naturally
identified with the dart $e'' y'$ on in $H''$, because the faces are
true.)  Hence a path exists from the true face $F(L_2)$ into another
true face, and from there any true face may be reached.

\case{flag-2} \claim{Each edge of $H''$ meets a true face or $S''$, where $S''$ is
the image of $S(H,L_1,x)$ in $D''$.}
Indeed, the function $\varphi'$ is an $S'$-flag on $H'$.  The edges of
$H'$ can be identified with a subset of the edges of $H''$.  For this
subset, the flag condition on edges is immediate.  Consider the
new  edges  (that is, edges of $H''$ that are not in $H'$).
They all meet $\{y,f y,\ldots,f^p y\}$.  This set is either contained
ini $S(H,L_1,x)$ (when $F_1$ is false), or is contained in the true face
$F_1$ (when $F_1$ is true).  Hence each new  edge meets
a true face or $S''$.


The other verifications are routine.
\end{proof}

\subsection{sequence}

The aim is to prove that every restricted hypermap with a given bound
on the size of the dart set is generated by a particular algorithm.
The proof is a long induction argument.  The proof starts by showing
how to go from one partially constructed hypermap to another more
fully constructed hypermap.  The hypermap $H$ represents the fully
constructed hypermap and two quotients $H/{\cal L}$ and $H/{\cal M}$
represent the partially constructed hypermaps.  The algorithm involves
the transition from the hypermap $H/{\cal L}$ to $H/{\cal M}$.  The
transition from one quotient to another is given by the transform of
marked hypermaps.  The transform thus represents one step of the
algorithm.  \indy{Notation}{M@$\cal M$ (normal family)}%

\begin{lemma}  Let $H$ be a restricted hypermap.  
There is a sequence of marked hypermaps
${\cal H}_i = (H,{\cal L}_i,L_i,x_i,\varphi_i)$ for $i=0,\ldots,k-1$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\varphi'_i$ is the canonical boolean function on $H/{\cal L}_i$, and
$\varphi_i$ is its lift to ${\cal L}_i$.
\item $H/{\cal L}_0$ is the cyclic hypermap of example~\ref{ex:H2}, with
chosen face $F$ given by the dart set of $L_0$.  
\item If the contour loop $L$ in the transform $T{\cal H}_i=(H,{\cal M},L,\ldots)$ 
is not face specific, then ${\cal H}_{i+1} = T{\cal H}_i$.
\item If the contour loop $L$ in the transform $T{\cal H}_i=(H,{\cal
    M},L,\ldots)$ is face specific, and there exists some other
  contour loop of ${\cal M}$ that is not face specific, then ${\cal
    H}_{i+1}$ has the form $(H,{\cal M},M,y,\varphi_{i+1})$, where $M$
  is not face specific.
\item The transform $(H,{\cal L}_k,\ldots)$ of ${\cal H}_{k-1}$ has a
  quotient $H/{\cal L}_k$ that is naturally isomorphic to $H$.
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let ${\cal H}_0=(H,{\cal L}_0,L_0,x_0,\varphi_0)$ be given as
  follows.  Pick any face $F$ of $H$, and construct the normal family
  ${\cal L}$ of Example~\ref{ex:H2}.

  The construction of ${\cal H}_{i+1}$ depends on the structure of the
  transform $(H,{\cal M},L,x,\psi)$ of ${\cal H}_i$.  We consider
  three cases.
\begin{nomerate}
\item 
\claim{[Every contour loop of ${\cal M}$ is face specific.]}   In this case,  by
Lemma~\ref{lemma:all-dart}, the quotient map $H\to H/{\cal M}$ is an
isomorphism.  Set $k= i+1$. The sequence terminates.
\item \claim{[The contour loop $L$ is not face specific.]}  In this
  case, from the inductive hypothesis that $\varphi'_i$ is the
  canonical function and the definition of $\psi$, it follows that
  $\psi'$ is the canonical function.  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:flag}, the
  transform is a marked hypermap.  Let ${\cal H}_{i+1}$ equal the
  transform of ${\cal H}_i$.
\item \claim{[The contour loop $L$ is face specific, but there exists
    another $M\in {\cal M}$ that is not face specific.]}  In this
  case, the canonical function on $H/{\cal M}$ is a flag (with
  $S=\emptyset$).  Pick any quotient dart $x'=[\ldots;y]$ in $H/{\cal
    M}$, that lies in the face $F(M)$ corresponding to $M$.  By the
  definition of flag, The dart $e' x'$ lies in a true face.  Let
  ${\cal H}_{i+1} = (H,{\cal M},M,y,\varphi_{i+1})$, where
  $\varphi'_{i+1}$ is the canonical function.  The canonical function
  is a flag, hence an $S(H,M,x)$-flag.  ${\cal H}_{i+1}$ is a marked
  hypermap.
\end{nomerate}

The sequence must terminate eventually, because each step
constructs a quotient of $H$ with more darts than the previous one and
the number of steps is bounded by the size of the dart set of
$H$.
\end{proof}

Next, we wish to describe the steps of the sequence in a way that
relies on a lesser degree on the structural details of the marked
hypermaps.  (These details will not be available to us in the
algorithm of the next subsection.)  The next lemma gives a way of
constructing a new hypermap from a given hypermap $H'$ that does not
require us to represent it first as a quotient $H' = H/{\cal L}$ for
some normal family.

\begin{definition}[R]\label{def:R}  
  Let $H$ be a hypermap and let $x$ be dart of $H$.  Let $r$ be the
  cardinality of the face of $x$, and let $m,p,q$ be integers that
  satisfy $m\ge 0$, $p\ge 0$, $0 \le m < q < r$, and $m+1 <
  p+q$. Construct a hypermap $R(H,x,m,p,q)$ from $H$ as follows.  First
  construct an edge from the node of $y = f^{m+1} x$ to the node of $z
  = f^{q+1} x$ (by the reverse double walkup of
  Remark~\ref{rem:reverse-double-walkup}).  Then insert $p$ new nodes
  (of degree $2$) along the constructed edge (again by reverse double
  walkup transformations).  This is $R(H,x,m,p,q)$.
\end{definition}
\indy{Notation}{R@$R$ (hypermap constructor)}

We can immediately relate this construction to the sequence of marked
hypermaps that we have constructed.


\begin{lemma} Let $(H,{\cal L},L,x,\varphi)$ be a marked hypermap,
  with $H$ restricted, and let $(H,{\cal{M}},M,x,\psi)$ be its
  transform.    Let $m$, $p$, $y$, and $z$ be
  the constants of Lemma~\ref{lemma:yz}.  Let $y'$ and $z'$ be the
  images of the darts $y$ and $z$ in $H/{\cal L} = (D',e',n',f')$.
  Write $y' = (f')^{m+1} x'$ and $z' = (f')^{q+1} x'$. 
Then $m,p,q$ satisfy the constraints of
  Definition~\ref{def:R}, and $H/{\cal M}$ is isomorphic to $R(H/{\cal{L}},x',m,p,q)$.
\end{lemma}

% XX this proof is quite rough.

\begin{proof}
By construction, the passage from $H/{\cal M}$ to $H/{\cal L}$ consists of a double
walkups to eliminate the nodes (of size two) at $f y$, $f^2 y,
\ldots, f^p y$, and then a double walkup to eliminate the edge that runs from the the node of
$y$ to the node of
$z$.  %The passage in the other direction from $H/{\cal L}$ to
%$H/{\cal M}$ comes by adding an edge from the node of $y$ to
%the node of $z$ and inserting $p$ new nodes (of degree two)
%along it.
If we play these double walkups in reverse,
one may also pass from $H/{\cal L}$ to $H/{\cal M}$.  
If
$m,p,q$ are chosen as above, then $R(H',x,m,p,q)$ is isomorphic to
$H/{\cal M}$.  
\end{proof}

\subsection{algorithm}

This final section puts the algorithm a precise form, based on
the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem.  (The Knaster-Tarski fixed
point theorem is a standard way to give precise mathematical form to
an algorithm.)

\begin{lemma}[Knaster-Tarski]\guid{EAOGWLE}\rating{ZZ}   
Let $X$ be a set.  Let $f:\powerset(X)\to \powerset(X)$ be a
function from the powerset of $X$ to itself.  Assume that $f$ is
monotonic in the sense that whenever $Y\subset Z\subset X$, it
follows that $f(Y) \subset f(Z)$.  Then $f$ has a least fixed point.
That is there exists a set $\op{fix}(f,X)\subset X$ such that
$f(\op{fix}(f,X)) = \op{fix}(f,X)$ and such that the following
minimality condition holds: if $Y\subset X$ is any set such that
$f(Y) \subset Y$, then $Y\subset \op{fix}(f,X)$.
\end{lemma}
\indy{Notation}{X@$X$ (set)}%
\indy{Notation}{f@$f$ (function on powerset)}%
\indy{Notation}{fix@$\op{fix}$~(Knaster-Tarski fixed point)}%
\indy{Notation}{P@$\powerset(\cdot)$ (powerset)}%
\indy{Index}{Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem}%

\begin{proof} Let $\op{fix}(f,X)$ be the intersection of all subsets
$Y$ of $X$ such that $f(Y)\subset Y$.  It is easily verified that
this set has the required properties.
\end{proof}

Various data are needed for the application of the Knaster-Tarski fixed-point theorem
to the construction of restricted hypermaps.  This data is presented in a series
of definitions.  The first definition gives a domain $D$ that will contain all the darts
of all the hypermaps that will be constructed.  In practice, we take $D$ to be a finite
subset of the set of natural numbers. The set of darts for some of
the hypermaps may be a proper subset of $D$.

\begin{definition}[D,~$\op{ch}$]
Let $D$ be any fixed finite set.    Fix a choice function
$\op{ch}:\powerset(D)\to D$ that picks an element from each nonempty
subset:
\begin{displaymath}
X\ne\emptyset\quad  \Rightarrow \quad  \op{ch}(X)\in X.
\end{displaymath}
\index{Notation}{D@$D$ (set of darts)}
\index{Notation}{ch@$\op{ch}$~(choice)} For example, when
$D\subset\ring{N}$, let $\op{ch}$ choose the least element of a subset
of $D$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[d]
Fix $d\ge 3$, representing an upper bound on the size of the faces of
the hypermaps that will be constructed.  (In applications to the
sphere packing problem, $d=6$.) 
\indy{Notation}{d3@$d$ (upper bound)}%
\end{definition}

 The following constructions depend on $D$ and
$d$, although the notation does not reflect this.
One may think of $X_1$ in the next definition as
holding the output of the algorithm and $X_2$ as the workspace that holds partially
constructed hypermaps.

\begin{definition}[$X$,~$X_1$,~$X_2$]
Define a set $X$ as the disjoint union of $X_1$ and $X_2$ as follows.
Let $X_1$ be the set of all hypermaps whose darts are elements of $D$.
Let $X_2$ be the set of four-tuples $(H,m,\varphi,x)$, where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $H$ is a
hypermap whose darts are elements of $D$, 
\item  $x$ is a dart in a false face of $H$,
\item $m\in\{0,\ldots,d-1\}$,
\item $S = \{f^i x\mid 1 \le i \le m\}$,
and
\item $\varphi$ is an $S$-flag on $H$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


The set $A$ in the following definition gives the initialization of the algorithm.

\begin{definition}[A]
Let $H$ be a fixed hypermap isomorphic to $H_{2d}$, with darts in $D$.
Let $\varphi$ be the canonical flag on $H$ (with one true face and one
false face).  Let $x$ be the value of the choice function on the false
face.  Set
\begin{displaymath}
A = \{(H,m,\varphi,x) \mid 0\le m \le d-1\}.
\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

The following set gives the indexing set for the iteration of the algorithm.

\begin{definition}[C]
Let $C$ be the set of of $4$-tuples $(m,p,q,r)$ that satisfy the following
constraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item $0\le m < q < r$.
\item $0\le p$.
\item $m+1 < p+q$.
\item $m+p+2 \le d$.
\item if $q+1\ne r$, then $m+p+3\le d$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}



Let $(H,m,\varphi,x)\in X_2$.
Let $r$ be the cardinality of the face of $x$.  Consider $p,q$ such that $(m,p,q,r)\in C$.
For each such $p,q$, construct the hypermap $R(H,x,m,p,q)$.  Recall
that this hypermap is constructed from $H$ by adding two faces $F_1$
and $F_2$ and eliminating the face $F$ of $x$.  All other faces can be
naturally identified.  Say that a boolean function $\psi$ on
$R(H,x,m,p,q)$ is an \newterm{extension} of the boolean function
$\varphi$ on $H$ if $\psi(F') =\varphi(F')$, when $F'\ne F$.
\indy{Index}{function!extension}%

The functions $f$ and $g$ give one iteration of the algorithm.


\begin{definition}[g]
Let $g(H,m,\varphi,x)$ be the following subset of $X$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $H'\in X_1\cap g(H,m,\varphi,x)$ if and only if there exists
$p,q$ with $(m,p,q,r)\in C$ such that $H'=R(H,x,m,p,q)$
and $\varphi(F')$ is true for all $F'\ne F$.
\item $(H',m',\psi,x')\in X_2\cap g(H,m,\varphi,x)$ if and only if
there exists $p,q$ satisfying the given constraints such that
$H'=R(H,x,m,p,q)$ and such that $\psi$ is an extension of
$\varphi$, and one of the following two conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\psi(F_1)$ is false;  $x' = x$; and  $p+m+1 \le m' \le r-1$.
\item $\psi(F_1)$ is true; $x'$ is the value of the choice
function on the union of false faces of $H'$; and $0 \le m' \le
r-1$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[f]
Given the function 
$g:X_2 \to \powerset(X)$, set 
\begin{displaymath}f(S) = A \cup (\bigcup \{g(s) \mid s\in S\cap
X_2\}).\end{displaymath}
\indy{Notation}{g@$g$(function)}%
\end{definition}

 Any function $f :\powerset(X)\to
\powerset(X)$ defined in this way is monotonic.  Thus, we have a Knaster-Tarski fixed
point set $\op{fix}(f,X)$.  The main result of this chapter is that a  fixed point construction
generates all restricted hypermaps:

\begin{lemma}\guid{BRGEFNH}\rating{2000}  
Define $f $ and $X$ as above (depending on $d\ge 3$ and $D\ne
\emptyset$) .    Then every restricted hypermap with at
most $\card(D)$ darts and such that every face has size at most $d$
is isomorphic to a hypermap in $\op{fix}(f,X)\cap X_1$.
\end{lemma}

In intuitive terms, by starting with the \newterm{seed} hypermaps in $A$
one may find all restricted hypermaps (for given $D$ and $d$) by
applying the function $f$ repeatedly:
\begin{displaymath}
A_0 = A = f(\emptyset),\quad A_1 = f(A_0),\quad A_2 = f(A_1),\ldots
\end{displaymath}
and by looking at the output $A_i \cap X_1$.
\indy{Index}{seed}%

\begin{proof} Let $H$ be a restricted hypermap whose dart set belongs
to $D$ and whose greatest face size is $d$.  It has a quotient
$H/{\cal L}_0$ isomorphic to $H_{2d}$.  By repeating the
construction of Section~\ref{sec:face-insert}, one obtains a
sequence of hypermaps $H_i = H/{\cal L}_i$, $i=0,\ldots,N$,
terminating with a hypermap $H/{\cal L}_N$, which is isomorphic to
$H$.  The data $m_i,\varphi_i,x_i$ is also obtained for each $H_i$.

The tuple $(H_0,m_0,\varphi_0,x_0)$ is isomorphic to an element of
$A$.  By construction, $A\subset \op{fix}(f,X)$.  If the lemma is false, there
is a smallest $i>0$ for which $(H_i,m_i,\varphi_i,x_i)\not\in \op{fix}(f,X)$ (or
if $i=N$, for which $H\not\in \op{fix}(f,X)$).  There are isomorphisms
$R(H_i,x_i,m_i,p_i,q_i) \simeq H_{i+1}$ for appropriate choices of
$p_i,q_i$.  By construction, when the data belongs to $\op{fix}(f,X)$ for $i-1$,
the data belongs to $\op{fix}(f,X)$ for $i$.  Thus, $H$ belongs to $\op{fix}(f,X)\cap X_1$.
\end{proof}

%\subsection{old algorithm}
%
%If a hypermap is restricted and $x$ is any dart, then $x$ and $n x$
% lie on different faces.  In particular, a restricted hypermap has at
% least two faces.  To begin the process, take ${\cal L}$ to be the
% normal family of Example~\ref{ex:H2} with two contour loops, whose
% quotient hypermap is a polygon $H_{2d}$.  When the the initial
% contour loop is chosen on a face of maximal size, the natural number
% $d$ is an upper bound on size of a face.
%
% In summary, a process starts with a single polygon and then adds
% edges and nodes of degree two along the inserted edges, to obtain a
% restricted hypermap $H$.
%
% A modification of the process avoids explicit reference to the
% hypermap $H$ and to the normal family ${\cal L}$.  Let $D$ be a
% finite set that contains all the darts for all of the restricted
% hypermaps to be constructed.  For each $d=3,\ldots,\# D$, the
% process generates all restricted hypermaps with greatest face-size
% $d$, with darts in $D$.
%
% The algorithms performs the following initialization.  The initial
% hypermap is the polygonal hypermap $H_{2d}$.  A flag $\varphi$ marks
% one face true and the other false.  A distinguished dart $x$ is
% selected on the false face.  For each $m<d$, set $S=S_m = \{f^i
% x\mid 1\le i\le m\}$.
%
% Each iteration processes a finite list ${\cal H}$ of quadruples
% $(H,m,\varphi,x)$, where $H$ is a simple hypermap, $\varphi$ is an
% $S$-flag, $x$ lies in a false face, and $S = \{f^i x\mid 1\le i\le
% m\}$ for some $m$.  The algorithm terminates when every face of
% every hypermap in ${\cal H}$ is true.  At every step of the
% algorithm, one quadruple with some false face is removed from ${\cal
%   H}$ and finitely many quadruples are returned to ${\cal H}$.
%
% At each iteration the chosen $(H,m,\varphi,x)$ is modified in the
% following ways and each modification is placed back in the list
% ${\cal H}$.  As the natural number $m$ depends on the unknown normal
% family ${\cal L}$, all possible $m < d$ are used.  Similarly, the
% natural number $p < d$ depends on ${\cal L}$, and all possible $p$
% are used.  Any quadruple that is isomorphic to one previously
% considered is discarded as redundant.
%
% In summary, the algorithm constructs of hypermaps.  The process must
% terminate, because the set $D$ is finite, so there are only finitely
% many quadruples (or quadruples up to isomorphism) that construct
% their dart sets from $D$.
%
%\begin{lemma}\guid{BRGEFNH}\rating{2000}  Fix $d\ge 3$ and $D\ne \emptyset$.
%  This process constructs in a finite number of steps all restricted
%  hypermaps, up to isomorphism, such that the dart set belongs to the
%  finite set $D$, and whose greatest face size is $d$.
%\end{lemma}
