\SYNOPSIS

Synopsis of vector library.

\DESCRIBE

The vector-related constants are:

 `vector:(A) list -> A^N` list to vector,
 `($):A^N->num->A` infix component selection,

Real vectors:

 `(+):real^N->real^N->real^N`, vector addition,
 `(-):real^N->real^N->real^N`, vector subtraction,
 `(--):real^N->real^N`, vector subtraction,
 `(%):real->real^N->real^N` infix scalar multiplication,
 `(dot):real^N->real^N->real` infix dot product,
 `vec:`:num->real^N`, construct a constant multiple of diagonal 1,1,1,1,1,...
 `norm:real^N->real`, norm of a vector,

Three dimensions:
 `(cross):real^3->real^3->real^3`, infix cross product,
 `det_vec3:real^3->real^3->real^3->real`, triple product,

One dimension:
 `lift:real->real^1`, lift a real number to a one-dimensional vector,
 `drop:real^1->real` drop a vector down to a real number,


 `vec 0`, the zero vector,
