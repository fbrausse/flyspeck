- Rewrote the interval/wide.cc to exploit that (y5==y6==4), grouping (x5-x6) together.
- giving better estimates on rr and del1.
- Hardwired assumption that delta > 15 into the code computing mdtau2.  This avoids certain unstable assumptions that were being thrown earlier.
In the same mdtau family is  (time was 1370 before).

There are two ways to pull out a subterm for special treatment.
Either a separate recursion can be done on the subterm to get an improved estimate.
Or certain terms can be frozen so that when the general recursion is done, they don't get updated.
