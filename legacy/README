The legacy directory contains material that was moved out of the
/text_formalization/ directory.  Some of it contains lemmas that were
proved early in the flyspeck formalization project, before the
revision of the proof in 2009.  Some of these lemmas are quite useful
and so they are kept here, even if they are not organized according to
the current version of "flypaper.pdf"

The theorems in /oldfan are a subset of the theorems in the
text_formalization/fan directory.  They differ only in the arrangement
of the material into files.
