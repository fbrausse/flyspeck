The legacy directory contains material that was moved out of the /text_formalization/
directory.  Some of it contains lemmas that were proved early in the flyspeck formalization project, before the revision of the proof in 2009.  Some of these lemmas are quite useful and so they are kept here, even if they are not organized according to the current version of "flypaper.pdf"
