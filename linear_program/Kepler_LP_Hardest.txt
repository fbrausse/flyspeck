In the lastest archive of tame hypermaps (April 2009), the hardest one to be contravened
is the one which has the hash code:
6657180

// June 21, 2009
Hashcode collisions detected so only 25567 basic LPs generated instead of
25702 as expected.
There are exactly 135 collisions.
After these are fixed, we are able to contraven all 25702 counterexamples.

I fixed all the hashcode collisions in the file keplergraph_fixedhash.out
But it's 4MB so I will send it directly to Prof. Hales.

IMPORTANT:
To use the Kepler_2009_genGraphDat.cpp, you have to create the folder GraphDat
in the same folder of the .cpp file. I mean that GraphDat folder and this .cpp
file must exist in the same folder before running the program.

I managed to define the type `:lineq`.
On the way to define the notion of `is_solution` and
the most basic theorem that multiplying both sides of
a linear equation with the same non-zero number resulting
in the same set of solutions.
