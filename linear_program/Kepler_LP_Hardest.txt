In the lastest archive of tame hypermaps (April 2009), the hardest one to be contravened
is the one which has the hash code:
6657180

// June 21, 2009
Hashcode collisions detected so only 25567 basic LPs generated instead of
25702 as expected.
There are exactly 135 collisions.
After these are fixed, we are able to contraven all 25702 counterexamples.
